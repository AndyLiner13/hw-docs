## Desktop Editor

 The desktop editor is the integrated game development environment for Worlds. It
allows you to build worlds and scenes, and to add and modify objects in your
worlds. The desktop editor runs on Windows, and you control it with the keyboard
and mouse, rather than your VR headset. Note: Building a world with the desktop editor is similar to building a game in

 The desktop editor allows you to:
• Create a world
• Add shapes, gizmos, sounds, and colliders to the world
• Create quests, leaderboards, and variable groups
• Create and edit scripts using TypeScript
• Publish the world
• and more

 Using the desktop editor to build your world makes it easier to:
• Make changes while the world is running
• Update entity property values
• Write and debug TypeScript code

 To install the desktop editor, see [Install the desktop editor](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/get-started/install-desktop-editor).

 TypeScript is a strongly-typed version of JavaScript. Strong typing provides
tight integration with your IDE, letting you:
• Leverage IntelliSense (code completion).
• Catch errors during development, rather than at runtime.

 To get started, see [Using TypeScript in Worlds](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/typescript/getting-started/using-typescript-in-horizon-worlds/).

## Custom Model Import

 The custom model import option in the desktop editor enables you to fill your
world with objects spawned from imported 3D models, created using your favorite 3D
creation tool. In Worlds, you refer to the resulting world as a custom model
world. You can find your imported assets in your personal asset library. The
following image shows an example of what a complex 3D object spawned from an imported

## Custom Model Import
...
 A custom 3D model is composed of multiple files, and you need to specify all of
them when you import a 3D model into the desktop editor. These files include:
• An FBX file. This is the 3D model file format. It contains the 3D mesh along
with scene data such as cameras, lighting, geometry, materials, and animations.
• One or more PNG files. These are image files, and they contain textures that map
onto the 3D model’s surface to make the spawned object look more realistic. You
can also create your own static lighting and collision models for your imported
3D models.

 To get started, see [Getting started with custom model import](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/custom-model-import/getting-started-with-custom-model-import).

## NPCs

 A Non-Player Character (NPC) is a computer-controlled character within a world
(as opposed to a user-controlled avatar). One example of such an NPC might be the
monster that patrols the hallways of a haunted house. Creators add NPCs to
their worlds for a variety of purposes, including:
• To provide information or quests to the player.
• To sell goods and services.
• To engage the player in conversation.
• To serve as enemies or obstacles for the player to overcome.
• To add to the game’s atmosphere and immersion.

## NPCs
...
 NPCs can range from simple scripted characters to complex AI-driven characters
that learn and adapt to the player’s actions. There are four types of archetype
NPC characters that you can spawn into your scene, according to your needs.
Utility, Storyteller, Antagonist, and Ally types of NPCs all exhibit behaviors that
are controlled with an AI script. These NPC archetypes act in the following ways:
• Utility: Utility NPCs perform basic functions to move a narrative or game experience
forward. For example, furthering quest lines, buying, selling, or trading items,
and directing the player to do something. Utility NPCs support scripting.
• Storyteller: Storyteller NPCs are conversationally driven. They operate within specific
guidelines you set to move a narrative forward, but with a comprehensive world
understanding and context, including the game state.
• Antagonist: These are enemy NPC characters. Antagonist NPCs can move, fight, and obstruct
the player from accomplishing an objective. You can add AI to control this

character archetype to add more personality and a higher level of decision-making
ability.
• Ally: Friendly NPC characters. Ally NPC characters are aligned with the player’s
objective. Ally NPC characters can operate on something in the scene. They can
follow the player, and they can hide from the player.

 The Performance tab displays a real-time view of all currently selected metrics. You can select
which metrics to display on the tab and you can also set a target number for
each metric. When a metric exceeds the defined target, a red dot appears next to
that metric as an alert. This tab also supports scrubbing and tracing. With
scrubbing, you can review data that has recently appeared on the Performance tab (approximately 30 seconds worth) in detail. With tracing, you can capture
performance data from your world to view in Perfetto. Perfetto is a third-party
tool for performance instrumentation and trace analysis. For more information, see [Using performance tools from web and mobile](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/performance-best-practices-and-tooling/performance-tools/using-performance-tools-from-web-and-mobile).

### Gen AI code tool

 Converting Worlds concepts into Typescript code can sometimes be a struggle.
However, the Gen AI code tool can help you with this. Built into the desktop
editor, the Gen AI tool is an authoritative, AI-powered chat assistant. It works like
a chat app and using it is as simple as having a back-and-forth, real-time
conversation with someone. In this case, that someone just happens to be a [large language model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model). The GenAI code tool has two types of models available: Llama, and Specialist.
The Llama model works well for quick questions or general information about
Worlds. The Specialist model is trained on TypeScript and the Worlds API. It can
generate scripts and answer more detailed questions about scripting and TypeScript.
The Specialist model works well as a personal tutor to learn TypeScript and

### Gen AI Creation Audio tool

 The Gen AI Creation Audio tool assists you in the audio creation process, making
adding sound a simple matter of clicking a few buttons. The Gen AI Audio tool
provides two audio generation modes: sound effect generation and ambient audio
generation. Sound effect generation is useful when attempting to create short
audio clips, while ambient audio generation is better for generating longer
background tracks. You can either select sounds based on example prompts, or you can
create your own custom prompts and see what sounds you can come up with. Once you
have that perfect sound, you can use it to create audio assets for your world or
download it to your local hard drive for future use. For more information, see the [Gen AI Creation Audio tool](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/desktop-editor/generative-ai-creation-tools/generative-ai-creation-audio-tool).
