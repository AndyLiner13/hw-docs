# Create your first world tutorial Overview

## Prerequisites

 As with all tutorials for Worlds, this tutorial requires a variety of
prerequisites, most of which are also required for creating most aspects of your world.
Click on each one for more information:
• [A Meta Horizon Worlds account](https://horizon.meta.com/)
• [Installing the Worlds desktop editor](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/get-started/install-desktop-editor)
• [Basic familiarity with TypeScript](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/typescript/typescript). To enable greater flexibility with the objects you place in your world, you’re
going to want to be able to write scripts that tell them what to do. Worlds
uses [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), a type-focused version of Java Script for this, and while using scripting is
optional, it will definitely add a lot to your world. It requires an IDE for use,

such as [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). Some of the tutorials, such as the introductory tutorial, [Create your own world, Part 2](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/get-started/intro-tutorial-part2) include scripting as part of the tutorial.
• (Optional) [An integrated development environment (IDE)](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/typescript/getting-started/adding-an-ide-to-desktop-editor) that’s set up and connected to the desktop editor. While this is optional, it
is necessary in order to do scripting in your world. We recommend [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), and it’s the one that is used throughout our tutorials. However, if you’d
