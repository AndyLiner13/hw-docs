# Welcome creators!

Welcome to Worlds

As a developer in Worlds, you are the creator, whether you code or you don’t. Worlds is an integrated game creation system that enables you to create a new world for users to play in and enjoy. What you create is up to you--you can choose to create a simple fishing game, a 3D walk-through of an ancient city, a rollicking first-person shooter, or a complex fantasy RPG. Literally, the sky’s the limit. Worlds gives you an easy-to-use desktop editor to use to create a new world and then add objects, scripts, sounds, and more.

As the creator of a world, you can:

* Create a world for your game.
* Add collaborators so you can build the world together with someone else.
* Add shapes, gizmos, sounds, and colliders to your world
* Insert stock assets or create custom ones to populate your world
* Create and edit scripts using TypeScript to add behaviors to objects in your world, or generate code snippets using AI
* Publish, or alternatively, delete your world.

When someone visits Worlds as a user, they always see the published version of a world. As a world creator, you can access both the published version and the editable version of your world.

## Getting started

The initial step toward creating your first world is to [install the desktop editor](/hw-docs/Get%20started/Install%20the%20desktop%20editor.md). This desktop editor is your main platform for creating a world, and it contains many other tools that you’ll find useful as you create. To see what tools are available to you as a creator, check out our [tools overview](/hw-docs/Get%20started/Tools%20overview.md).
After you’ve installed the desktop editor, we suggest you try the [create your first world tutorial](/hw-docs/Get%20started/Create%20your%20first%20world%20tutorial,%20part%201.md). This is the first of a two-part tutorial where you’ll learn how to create a simple game in Worlds. You can follow this up with the second part of the tutorial, which continues to walk you through building a simple game. In these two introductory tutorials, you’ll experience most of the basic aspects of working with a world, such as:

* Creating your world
* Setting up the tooling you need
* Selecting and manipulating assets for your world
* Importing custom models
* Adding entities and scripting behavior for them
* Previewing your world for playtesting
* Trying your world out both on mobile and in virtual reality
* Publishing your world on mobile
