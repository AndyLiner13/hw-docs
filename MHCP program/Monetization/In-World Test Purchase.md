This feature allows the world owner to test in-world purchases for free, making it easy for creators to test their in-world purchases (IWP) before publishing or updating a world.
World owners are able to test purchase items at no cost and delete items from their inventory, allowing for simple iteration and testing of scripted logic around items before making them available to visitors for purchase.

## Prerequisites

Enrollment in the Meta Horizon Creator Program is a prerequisite to accessing monetization tools offered to creators in Meta Horizon Worlds, including test-world purchases. Program members must also agree to the [IWP Offering Terms](https://horizon.meta.com/creator) in order to access the Commerce tab in their Creator User Interface (CUI).

For more information and instructions on how to create an IWP item, please review the [Meta Horizon Worlds In-World Purchase Guide](In-world%20purchase%20guide.md).

## Test purchasing an IWP item

This functionality is available in Edit/Preview Mode and in Visit Mode. To most accurately test the visitor purchase experience, we recommend testing in Visit Mode. On the World detail page, select “Published world page” and “Visit” to travel there.

- **Location**: The floor occupies the lower half of the image, stretching horizontally across the frame.
- **Contents**: The tiles are uniform in size and color, with no additional markings or textures.
- **Visual Styling**: The tiles have a slightly darker grout line separating them, giving a sense of depth.

- **Visual Description**: The sky above is a gradient of blue, transitioning from a lighter shade at the horizon to a deeper blue higher up.
- **Location**: The sky spans the upper half of the image.
- **Contents**: The sky is clear without any clouds or gradients.
- **Visual Styling**: The edges of the sky meet the horizon seamlessly, indicating a flat, open space.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
- **Most Prominent Visually**: The tiled floor is the most prominent feature due to its large area and distinct texture.
- **Arrows, Lines, Connectors**: There are no arrows, lines, or connectors present in the image.
- **Spatial Relationships**: The floor and sky are adjacent but do not interact visually. The horizon line separates the two regions clearly.
