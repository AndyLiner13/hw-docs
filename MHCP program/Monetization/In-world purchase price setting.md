# In-world purchase price setting

In-world purchase details may be set and edited via headset or through the Desktop Editor. Price points for in-world purchases can range between 25 - 20,000 Meta Credits.

> **Note:**
> Creators are advised to change prices when in-game activity is lowest. Players in-world during a price change must leave and re-enter the world or receive an error when attempting to purchase in-world items.

## Setting prices from the Desktop Editor:

* Navigate to **Systems > Commerce**.
* Select an in-world item from the list; this will open a pop-up window.
* Enter a value between 25 - 20,000 Meta Credits in the **Sell Price** field.
* Click **Create**.

## Setting prices from the VR Editor:

* Navigate to **Systems > Commerce > In-game items**
* Click the menu icon next to the applicable item and select **Edit Price**
* Enter a value between 25 - 20,000 Meta Credits in the **Sell Price** field
* Click **Create**

Upon completion, a notification will appear confirming the price has successfully been changed.
