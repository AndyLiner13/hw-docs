**Can I earn money in the program?**

Yes, you must be a program member to get access to monetization tools, services, and bonuses, as well as the opportunity to enter creator competitions and win cash prizes. All program members now have access to the same [monetization opportunities](/hw-docs/MHCP%20program/Monetization/Monetization%20opportunities.md).

**I’m a mobile developer. Is this program right for me?**

Yes! Meta Horizon Worlds is available on mobile, and we’re looking to expand our offerings of games, worlds, and immersive experiences across platforms, including mobile devices.

**What hardware do I need to create in Meta Horizon Worlds?**

You’ll need a PC and optimally a Meta Quest headset as well. Unfortunately, our creation tools are not yet available on MacOS or Linux. You can learn more about PC requirements [here](https://www.meta.com/help/quest/140991407990979/?srsltid=AfmBOoqmbBdp87U6V5PK-AmESiSGuuSMilSBT3vpcDh_zBGIiPkMsUmn).

**What experience do I need to join?**

Whether you’re an experienced creator coming in from another platform, a Meta Horizon enthusiast, or looking to create your first world, this program is for you. Just be curious, creative, and ready to build!

**What are the eligibility guidelines to join the program?**

To join the Meta Horizon Creator Program, you must:

* Be age 18 or older
* Reside in a supported country; excluding Korea, Japan, and the U.S. Territories (American Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and U.S. Virgin Islands)
* Have a Meta account in good standing

Meta full-time employees, interns, and contingent workers are not eligible for the program.

**I live in a location that’s not yet eligible to join. When will more countries be added?**

We are working to expand program access to more locations, but we don’t yet have a specific timeline.

**How long is my membership good for?**

There are no term limits on your membership. If your account remains active and in good standing you will remain in the program. Specific program benefits may change over time.

**How can I become a Meta Horizon Creator Partner?**

We’re looking for creators who’ve published great content on Meta Horizon or other platforms and will act as role models and leaders in the community.

In addition to meeting the eligibility guidelines to join the Meta Horizon Creator Program, partners must also:

* Be actively editing, testing, and/or have published at least 1 world on Meta Horizon and have at least 400 monthly active users in 1 world in the past 30 days; and/or
* Have published at least 1 equivalent mobile game or metaverse experience on a platform such as Roblox, VR Chat, or Fortnite, and have at least 400 monthly active users in 1 world

You can learn more about becoming a partner [here](/hw-docs/MHCP%20program/How%20to%20Become%20a%20Meta%20Horizon%20Creator%20Partner.md).

**I applied to become a partner but haven’t heard back yet. When will I be notified?**

We are regularly reviewing applications. You will be notified of your application’s status as soon as possible.

If you reside in a location that’s not one of our supported countries, your application is pending for 90 days. If your location opens within that time frame, we will review your application and notify you. If not, you will need to reapply after 90 days.

**My application was unsuccessful. Why didn’t I get in? What happens now?**

We know that this can be a disappointing result. Successful applicants often come from developers and creators who have shipped great content on Meta Horizon Worlds or other platforms, and/or those who have contributed to the ecosystem of developers creating immersive content.

Although you weren’t eligible to be a partner at this time, if you’ve met the eligibility guidelines to be in the Meta Horizon Creator Program, you’ve been automatically enrolled and will get access to exclusive program benefits, including monetization opportunities and educational programming.
