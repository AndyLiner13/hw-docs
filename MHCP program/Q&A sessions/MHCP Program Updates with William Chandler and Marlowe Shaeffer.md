A Town Hall Q&A to hear the latest news, updates, and opportunities within the Meta Horizon Creator Program.`

Time Stamps for Q&A

[22:15] In what ways will the new expansion affect current MHCP members?

[23:10] Why are the EA channels being shut down? Will information and access to crucial resources be lost? Will Meta developers be invited to MHCP channels?

[23:49] Are all participants bound by the same Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) or should we exercise caution regarding the information we discuss?

[24:46] Is it a requirement that collaborators for mentor sessions be members of the MHCP program?

[25:24] You mentioned that monetization might not be available to all new members. What criteria will be used to determine eligibility for monetization or bonuses? Will new members have access to the In-World-Purchases (IWP) feature if bonuses are not available?

[26:41] William, would you like to address the Scout House role?

[27:48] With the expansion of the program, are there plans to bring on new mentors?
