[0:09] Intro

[24:26] How do you measure the effectiveness of each loop in user testing and feedback?

[27:05] Can I apply gameplay loops to worlds that aren’t games?

[29:16] Can you share an example of a 3p world (non meta/2p) that you think integrates all three loops exceptionally well?

[34:26] What external tools, if any, would you recommend for planning and keeping track of gameplay loops in HW?

[35:53] I’m curious how traditional gameplay loops translate into VR with all the spatial differences?

[39:08] Do you feel it’s necessary to have instructions at spawn, or can you have a world that intuitively can be discovered and learned?

[42:44] During the ideation phase, at what step do gameplay loops come in?

[45:07] Given the unique nature of how designing is done in Meta Horizon Worlds, do you find it easier to gray box everything and plan it all first before designing the entire world, or do you design and brainstorm as you go? What do you suggest works best for the Meta Horizon Worlds platform?

[48:38] Can you share tools and resources to learn more things like this?

[50:55] Outro
