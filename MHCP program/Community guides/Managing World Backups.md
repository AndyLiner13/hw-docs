# Managing World Backups

You can manage world backups in the [Developer Dashboard](https://developers.meta.com/horizon/manage/) or in VR.

## Managing backups in VR

This feature will allow creators to view the list of backups, make new backups, edit names and descriptions of backups, and restore previous backups from the Creator UI (CUI). Follow these steps to get started:

- Go to Meta Horizon Worlds.
- Visit any world in “**Edit**” mode.
- Enter “ **Build** ” mode (pull down on right joystick).
- Open CUI (press context menu button on left joystick).
- Open World tab.

### Overview
This image depicts a user interface screen from a software application, specifically showing a "Backups" section within a "World" settings menu. The layout includes a sidebar with menu options and a main content area displaying backup information and actions.

### Key Elements

- **Main Content Area**: Positioned on the right, with a dark background and lighter text. Displays a heading "Backups" at the top. Below the heading, there is a message explaining the purpose of backups and a note about the current version being saved. Two backup entries are listed, each with a timestamp and a "Restore" button next to them.
- **"Save Backup" Button**: Located at the top-right corner of the main content area, with a purple background and white text.
- **"Restore" Buttons**: Three "Restore" buttons appear next to the backup entries, each with a white icon and a gray background.
- **Bottom Navigation Bar**: At the bottom of the screen, there is a navigation bar with several icons, one of which is highlighted with a red border. This icon resembles a globe, suggesting a world or map-related function.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual element is the "Backups" heading in the main content area. The "Restore" buttons are secondary but important interactive elements. The "Save Backup" button is less prominent but still noticeable due to its contrasting color. The bottom navigation bar provides additional functionality, with the globe icon being the focal point of the bottom bar.
