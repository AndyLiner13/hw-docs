# Tutorial Prerequisites

Before you begin exploring these tutorials, please verify that you have met the following requirements.

## Meta Horizon Worlds Account

You need a Meta Horizon Worlds account. See <https://horizon.meta.com/>.

## Meta Quest Link App on Your Desktop

You must install the Meta Quest Link application on your desktop. See [Install Oculus app for Meta Quest Link](https://www.meta.com/help/quest/articles/headsets-and-accessories/oculus-rift-s/install-app-for-link/).

## Desktop Editor

The desktop editor is the interface for building your worlds and the TypeScript scripts to support them. This desktop application is available for download and is auto-updated with each release of the platform. For installation instructions, see [Install and run the desktop editor](/hw-docs/Get%20started/Install%20the%20desktop%20editor.md).

## TypeScript Basics

TypeScript is the scripting language used in building Meta Horizon Worlds. TypeScript extends core JavaScript with strict data typing, which provides better support for complex programming structures.

For a brief overview of TypeScript, see [Using TypeScript in Meta Horizon Worlds](/hw-docs/Scripting/Get%20started%20with%20TypeScript/Using%20TypeScript%20in%20Meta%20Horizon%20Worlds.md).

For a tutorial, see [TypeScript Tutorial](/hw-docs/Scripting/Get%20started%20with%20TypeScript/TypeScript%20Tutorial.md).

## Optional

#### IDE

An integrated development environment (IDE) can be connected to the desktop editor for building your TypeScript scripts.

**Visual Studio Code is recommended.**

For more information, see [Adding an IDE to Desktop Editor](/hw-docs/Scripting/Get%20started%20with%20TypeScript/Adding%20an%20IDE%20to%20the%20desktop%20editor.md).
