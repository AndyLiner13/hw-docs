# Module 14 - Particle VFX System

 The particle VFX system provides visual feedback for mining actions, tool usage,
resource collection, and other game events to enhance the player experience.  

## System components

  

### VFXSystem.ts

 This script manages visual effects throughout the game, providing feedback for
various player actions and game events.  

#### Key features

• Mining Effects: Particle effects when tools hit resource nodes
• Collection Effects: Visual feedback when resources are gathered
• Tool Effects: Special effects for different tool tiers and actions
• Currency Effects: Visual feedback during resource conversion
• Achievement Effects: Celebration effects for milestones and accomplishments

  

#### Property description

• miningParticles: Particle effects for different resource types being mined
• collectionEffect: Visual effect when resources are collected
• toolTrails: Trail effects for different tool tiers
• conversionBurst: Effect played during resource conversion
• achievementEffect: Celebration effect for achievements

  

## Visual effect types

  

### Mining effects

 Different particle effects for different resource types:
• Wood Mining: Wood chips and dust particles
• Stone Mining: Stone fragments and sparks
• Crystal Mining: Glowing crystal shards and magical effects

  

### Tool effects

 Visual feedback based on tool tier and type:
• Basic Tools: Simple spark effects
• Advanced Tools: More elaborate particle trails
• Master Tools: Premium effects with special animations

  

### Collection feedback

 Resource collection visual confirmation:
• Resource Pickup: Glowing effect when items enter inventory
• Capacity Warning: Visual indicator when approaching inventory limits
• Overflow Alert: Effect when inventory is full

  

## Integration with game systems

  

### Resource node integration

 VFX triggers are called from ResourceNode scripts:
• Mining action triggers appropriate particle effect
• Node depletion shows completion effect
• Respawn includes restoration visual

  

### Tool system integration

 Tool actions automatically trigger corresponding effects:
• Pickaxe swings show impact particles
• Tool durability warnings include visual indicators
• Tool upgrades show enhancement effects

  

### Achievement system integration

 Major milestones trigger celebration effects:
• First tool purchase shows success effect
• Tier upgrades include progression visuals
• FTUE completion shows achievement effect

  

## Performance optimization

  

### Efficient particle management

• Object Pooling: Reuse particle effect instances
• Culling: Disable effects when not visible to players
• Level of Detail: Reduce complexity based on distance
• Mobile Optimization: Simplified effects for mobile devices

  

### Battery and performance considerations

• Effect Duration: Keep effects brief to reduce processing load
• Particle Count: Limit simultaneous particle systems
• Update Frequency: Optimize particle update rates
• Quality Scaling: Adaptive quality based on device performance

  

## Customization guide

  

### Adding new effects

1. Create particle effect entity with desired visual properties.
2. Configure particle system parameters (lifetime, velocity, color, etc.).
3. Add effect trigger to appropriate game system script.
4. Test effect timing and visual impact.
5. Optimize for mobile performance.

  

### Modifying existing effects

1. Locate the effect entity in the world.
2. Adjust particle system properties:
  • Emission rate and particle count
  • Color gradients and transparency
  • Scale and velocity parameters
  • Lifetime and spawn patterns
3. Update trigger conditions if needed.
4. Test across different scenarios and device types.

  

## Best practices

  

### Visual design principles

• Clarity: Effects should clearly communicate their purpose
• Consistency: Similar actions should have similar visual styles
• Timing: Effects should feel responsive and well-timed
• Subtlety: Avoid overwhelming players with excessive effects

  

### Technical implementation

• Performance First: Always prioritize smooth gameplay over visual flair
• Graceful Degradation: Provide fallbacks for lower-performance devices
• Efficient Triggers: Only play effects when they add meaningful value
• Memory Management: Properly clean up effect instances
