# Module 10 - HUD System

 The HUD (Heads-Up Display) system provides real-time visual feedback to players
about their current state, resources, tools, and progress. It creates an
engaging and informative user interface that keeps players informed about their game
status.  

## System components

  

### HUD.ts

 The HUD script manages the visual interface elements that overlay the player’s
view. It displays critical information and provides feedback for player actions. Key features:
• Resource Display: Real-time inventory and capacity information
• Currency Tracking: Current currency amounts and conversion rates
• Tool Status: Current tool information, durability, and upgrade options
• Progress Indicators: Mining progress, extraction status, and achievements
• Interactive Elements: Buttons and controls for player actions

  

### HUD properties

 The HUD system tracks and displays:
• resourceCounters: Current amounts of wood, stone, crystal, and other resources
• currencyDisplays: Green, blue, purple, and red currency balances
• toolInformation: Current tool tier, durability, and stats
• capacityIndicators: Current inventory usage vs. maximum capacity
• progressBars: Mining progress, extraction timers, and other activities
• notifications: Achievement unlocks, upgrade availability, and system messages

  

## Display elements

  

### Resource counters

 The HUD shows current resource inventory:
• Wood Counter: Number of wood resources in inventory
• Stone Counter: Current stone resource count
• Crystal Counter: Crystal resources available
• Capacity Bar: Visual representation of inventory fullness

  

### Currency displays

 Real-time currency tracking:
• Green Currency: Basic currency from wood conversion
• Blue Currency: Intermediate currency from stone conversion
• Purple Currency: Advanced currency from crystal conversion
• Red Currency: Premium currency from rare resource conversion

  

### Tool information panel

 Current tool status display:
• Tool Name: Currently equipped tool identification
• Tool Tier: Current upgrade level and progression
• Durability Bar: Tool health and usage remaining
• Efficiency Stats: Tool performance metrics

  

### Progress indicators

 Activity feedback systems:
• Mining Progress: Real-time mining action progress
• Extraction Timer: Countdown for resource extraction completion
• Respawn Timers: When resource nodes will become available again
• Upgrade Progress: Progress toward next tool tier

  

## Interactive elements

  

### Action buttons

 Touch-friendly controls for mobile devices:
• Mine Button: Primary action for resource extraction
• Store Access: Quick access to store interface
• Tool Management: Equipment and upgrade controls
• Menu Navigation: Settings and world navigation

  

### Information panels

 Expandable information displays:
• Tool Comparison: Stats comparison for upgrade decisions
• Resource Values: Current conversion rates and market information
• Achievement Progress: Goal tracking and milestone indicators
• Help System: Contextual tips and tutorials

  

## Integration with other systems

  

### SimPlayer integration

• HUD receives real-time updates from SimPlayer state changes.
• Tool equipment changes immediately update HUD displays
• Resource collection automatically updates counters
• Currency changes reflect instantly in displays

  

### Resource system integration

• Mining actions trigger progress bar updates
• Resource collection updates inventory displays
• Capacity warnings when approaching limits
• Node respawn timers from ResourceNode system

  

### Store system integration

• Purchase confirmations and feedback
• Currency deduction notifications
• Tool upgrade previews and comparisons
• Availability notifications for new items

  

## Mobile optimization

  

### Touch-friendly design

 The HUD is specifically designed for mobile devices:
• Large Buttons: Easy to tap with fingers
• Clear Spacing: Prevents accidental touches
• High Contrast: Readable in various lighting conditions
• Responsive Layout: Adapts to different screen sizes

  

### Performance optimization

 Mobile-specific optimizations:
• Efficient Updates: Minimal redraw operations
• Battery Friendly: Optimized refresh rates
• Memory Conscious: Lightweight display elements
• Network Efficient: Minimal data usage for updates

  

## Customization guide

  

### Modifying display elements

1. Locate the HUD.ts script.
2. Find the display component you want to modify.
3. Adjust properties like:
  • Position and size of UI elements
  • Colors and visual styling
  • Update frequency and triggers
  • Animation effects and transitions

  

### Adding new displays

1. Define the new display element in HUD.ts.
2. Create update functions for the new element.
3. Integrate with relevant game systems for data.
4. Add visual styling and positioning.
5. Test on mobile devices for usability.

  

### Creating custom notifications

1. Design notification system architecture.
2. Implement trigger conditions for notifications.
3. Create visual and audio feedback systems.
4. Add persistence for important notifications.
5. Integrate with achievement and progress systems.

  

## Visual design guidelines

  

### Consistency principles

• Color Scheme: Consistent color coding throughout the interface
• Typography: Readable fonts and appropriate sizing
• Spacing: Uniform spacing and alignment
• Animation: Smooth transitions and feedback animations

  

### Accessibility considerations

• Color Blind Support: Alternative indicators beyond color
• Font Size: Appropriate sizing for mobile viewing
• Contrast Ratios: High contrast for visibility
• Clear Icons: Universally understandable symbols

  

## Performance monitoring

  

### Update optimization

 The HUD system optimizes performance through:
• Selective Updates: Only refresh changed elements
• Batched Operations: Group multiple updates together
• Frame Rate Management: Maintain smooth 60fps performance
• Memory Pooling: Reuse UI elements efficiently

  

### Mobile performance

 Specific mobile optimizations:
• GPU Acceleration: Hardware-accelerated rendering where possible
• Texture Management: Efficient sprite and texture usage
• Draw Call Optimization: Minimize rendering operations
• Battery Impact: Minimize CPU usage for longer play sessions

  

## Testing and validation

  

### Cross-device testing

• Screen Sizes: Test on various mobile device screen sizes
• Resolution Scaling: Ensure proper scaling across different resolutions
• Performance Testing: Validate smooth operation on lower-end devices
• Touch Responsiveness: Verify all interactive elements work properly

  

### User experience validation

• Readability Testing: Ensure all text is clearly readable
• Touch Target Sizing: Verify buttons are appropriately sized
• Information Hierarchy: Check that important information is prominently displayed
• Flow Testing: Validate smooth user interaction patterns

  

## Best practices

  

### Design principles

• Clarity First: Information should be immediately understandable
• Minimal Clutter: Only show essential information by default
• Contextual Relevance: Display information relevant to the current activity.
• Consistent Feedback: Provide clear feedback for all player actions

  

### Technical implementation

• Modular Design: Create reusable UI components
• Event-Driven Updates: Use efficient event systems for updates
• Error Handling: Graceful degradation when systems fail
• Documentation: Clear documentation for future modifications

  

### User experience

• Progressive Disclosure: Advanced information available but not overwhelming
• Customization Options: Allow players to adjust display preferences
• Learning Curve: Design for both new and experienced players
• Accessibility: Ensure the interface works for all players
