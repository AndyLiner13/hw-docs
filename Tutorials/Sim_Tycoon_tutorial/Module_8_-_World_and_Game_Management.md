# Module 8 - World and Game Management

## System components

  
### World.ts

 The World script is the main game controller that handles:
• Player Management: Tracks all players in the world and their associated SimPlayer instances
• System Initialization: Sets up all game systems when the world starts
• Event Coordination: Manages communication between different systems
• Global State: Maintains world-wide settings and configurations
• Performance Monitoring: Tracks system performance and optimizes accordingly

### Core responsibilities

  
#### Player lifecycle management


• Detects when players join the world
• Creates SimPlayer instances for new players
• Manages player spawning and initial setup
• Handles player disconnection cleanup
• Maintains player count limits (max 8 players)

  
#### System coordination


• Initializes ToolGroups and ensures tool availability
• Sets up resource nodes and their respawn timers
• Configures store systems and pricing
• Establishes save game connections
• Coordinates HUD and UI systems

  
#### World state management


• Maintains global game settings and rules
• Tracks world-wide statistics and metrics
• Manages time-based events and cycles
• Handles world reset and cleanup operations
• Ensures consistent state across all systems

## Player management system

  
### Player joining process

 When a new player joins the world:
1. Detection: World.ts detects the new player entity.
2. SimPlayer Creation: Creates associated SimPlayer wrapper.
3. Tool Assignment: Assigns starting tools from ToolGroups.
4. Save Data Loading: Attempts to load existing player progress.
5. HUD Initialization: Sets up player-specific UI elements.
6. Spawn Placement: Places player in appropriate starting location.
7. Tutorial Check: Determines if FTUE should be triggered.

  
### Player departure handling

 When a player leaves:
1. Tool Return: All equipped tools are returned to their pools.
2. State Saving: Current progress is saved to player variables.
3. Resource Cleanup: Player inventory is processed appropriately.
4. Memory Cleanup: SimPlayer instance is properly disposed.
5. Pool Management: Tool pools are optimized for remaining players.

## Configuration management

  
### Global settings

 The World system manages global configuration:
• Player Limits: Maximum concurrent players (default: 8)
• Respawn Rates: Global multipliers for resource respawn times
• Economic Rates: Base conversion rates and pricing scales
• Difficulty Settings: Global modifiers for mining difficulty
• Event Triggers: World-wide events and their conditions

  
### System parameters


• Tool Pool Sizes: Initial and maximum sizes for tool pools
• Save Intervals: How frequently player data is saved
• Performance Thresholds: Limits for system optimization
• Debug Settings: Development and testing configurations

## Event system

  
### Global events

 The World system can trigger world-wide events:
• Resource Bonuses: Temporary increases in resource generation
• Economic Events: Market fluctuations or special pricing
• Tool Promotions: Temporary upgrade discounts
• Seasonal Changes: Time-based world modifications

  
### System notifications


• Player Achievements: Broadcasts significant player accomplishments
• System Status: Performance warnings or optimization notifications
• Economic Updates: Changes to global pricing or rates
• Maintenance Alerts: System updates or scheduled events

## Customization guide

  
### Modifying world settings


1. Locate the World.ts script configuration section.
2. Adjust global parameters:
  • `maxPlayers`: Maximum concurrent players
  • `resourceMultipliers`: Global resource generation rates
  • `economicRates`: Base currency and pricing scales
  • `performanceSettings`: Optimization thresholds

  
### Adding world events


1. Define event conditions and triggers.
2. Implement event effects on game systems.
3. Create notification systems for players.
4. Add event persistence for cross-session continuity.

  
### Performance tuning


1. Monitor player count and system load.
2. Adjust pool sizes based on usage patterns.
3. Optimize update frequencies for different systems.
4. Implement dynamic quality scaling for performance.
