## Creating in-world items

 In-world items are tied to the world in which they are created, and can only be
created by owners and editors of the world. This means that in order for the
shop to work as expected the in-world items for this tutorial will need to be
created by you. Follow the [In-World Purchase Guide: Creating An Item](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/mhcp-program/monetization/meta-horizon-worlds-inworld-purchase-guide#creating-an-item) to create the following in-world items:
• Apple
• Apple Pie
• Faster Apples
• Faster Pies
• Gem
• Oven

  

## Consumable vs. durable: What’s the difference?

 A consumable in-world item is something that can be granted to a player, and is
able to be spent or removed from their world inventory. It is also possible to
grant players more than one of the consumable items, making them perfect for soft
currencies, and reflective of the way that in-world items are typically used in
an economy. Conversely, a durable item is granted to a player once and is not able to be
removed from their inventory. This is obviously a little less appropriate for our
situation. When creating your items, make sure to set each item type to “consumable”, and
set Meta credits to “off”. ![Create in-world item](https://scontent-dfw5-2.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/496298898_715823360955618_2823011568742079658_n.jpg?_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=e280be&_nc_ohc=2YJVVDashXMQ7kNvwEsya74&_nc_oc=AdmyAfVpi73bCH-qZllRxeyg_hum-_2_4q1aKfszYCnA45JdaRW5xauovuDSry67C5g&_nc_zt=14&_nc_ht=scontent-dfw5-2.xx&_nc_gid=R0t2TPSAhLH8_uFtSpfuAw&oh=00_AfeI8yPsUzDmalW5u4lpdj...

 Once you have created the items, the Commerce panel should list them as follows (though your items will have different SKUs). ![In-World Items](https://scontent-dfw5-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/496451051_715823367622284_7930578693402803036_n.jpg?_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=e280be&_nc_ohc=Oj1tkiYhDUIQ7kNvwG-8BKG&_nc_oc=Adl67pWPH2g0T2r3IVn1bj9fhbcljcwOJ3KAivoIOSvumW1Ajxc6ZmCacn-r1T2i5fk&_nc_zt=14&_nc_ht=scontent-dfw5-1.xx&_nc_gid=R0t2TPSAhLH...

1. Use the viewport camera to position the item in the center of the frame. You can
change the camera speed to make positioning the camera easier.
