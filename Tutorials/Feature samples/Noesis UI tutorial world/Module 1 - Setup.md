### Overview
This image depicts a user interface (UI) design station within a software application, likely related to UI customization or asset management. The layout is divided into two main sections labeled as "Station 1: Texts & Fonts" and "Station 2: Image from Asset."

### Key Elements
1. **Station 1: Texts & Fonts**
   - **Visual description**: A rectangular panel with rounded corners.
   - **Location**: Top-left section of the image.
   - **Contents**: Contains text instructions and a list of custom UI fonts.
     > "Add text to your UI, choosing the font that best suits the style of your project."
     > "CUSTOM UI FONTS"
     > "Anton"
     > "Bangers"
     > "Oswald"
     > "Roboto"
     > "Roboto-Mono"
   - **Visual styling**: Light blue background, white text, and a darker blue header.

2. **Station 2: Image from Asset**
   - **Visual description**: Another rectangular panel with rounded corners.
   - **Location**: Top-right section of the image.
   - **Contents**: Displays placeholder text and a small preview image.
     > "Display imported images to enhance your environments or supplement your menus!"
     > "IMAGE FROM ASSET"
     > (Small preview image showing a character in a fantasy setting)
   - **Visual styling**: Similar light blue background and white text as Station 1, but with a slightly different header color.

3. **Custom UI Fonts Panel**
   - **Visual description**: A smaller, floating panel within Station 1.
   - **Location**: Below the main header of Station 1.
   - **Contents**: Lists specific fonts.
     > "Anton"
     > "Bangers"
     > "Oswald"
     > "Roboto"
     > "Roboto-Mono"
   - **Visual styling**: Light blue background, white text, and a darker blue header.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
- **Most prominent visually**: The two main stations (Station 1 and Station 2).
- **Arrows/lines/connectors**: None visible.
- **Spatial relationships**: Station 1 is on the left, Station 2 is on the right. The Custom UI Fonts panel is nested within Station 1.

Note

 Changes to **.noesis** and XAML files require reuploading to the Desktop Editor. Before making edits, ensure the [approved fonts](../../../Desktop%20editor/NoesisUI/Noesis%20UI%20Fonts%20Usage.md) have been downloaded in preparation.

## What You’ll Learn

By the end of this tutorial, you’ll be able to:

* Install NoesisGUI and open the provided tutorial project
* Upload and use Noesis assets in Horizon Worlds
* How to navigate the sample stations and understand their structure
* Find official resources and troubleshooting help

## NoesisGUI

NoesisGUI is a high-performance UI framework for games and interactive applications. In this training, you’ll use pre-built sample projects and stations to learn UI concepts, scripting integration, and best practices for Horizon Worlds.

**Key Features**

* **High Performance:** Built for real-time applications, NoesisGUI is lightweight and optimized for both desktop and mobile platforms.
* **XAML-Based:** Design your UI using XAML, a declarative markup language that separates design from logic and makes complex interfaces easier to manage.
* **Modern UI Capabilities:** Supports animations, data binding, vector graphics, and advanced layout controls.
* **Designer-Developer Workflow:** Enables artists and developers to work in parallel, using familiar tools like Visual Studio and VSCode with live XAML preview.

In this tutorial, making additional updates and reuploading the NoiesisGUI project file is optional.

If you would like to expand upon the tutorial, follow these steps:

- Ensure the project has been saved and all assets (XAML, images, scripts) are included.
- Upload to Horizon Asset Library
  * Open Horizon Worlds and go to the Asset Library
  * Click “Add new”
  * Locate the folder that includes your project
  * Select the **.noesis** project file.
- Add the Noesis Gizmo to Your World
  * In the Horizon Worlds editor, open your world
  * From the Asset Library, drag and drop the uploaded Noesis gizmo into your scene
  * Position and attach TypeScript components as needed

## Next Steps

Once you’ve completed the setup:

* Move on to the next module to explore the stations in detail
* Follow the documentation for each station to understand its UI features and scripting integration
* Use the provided XAML and TypeScript examples to experiment and learn
