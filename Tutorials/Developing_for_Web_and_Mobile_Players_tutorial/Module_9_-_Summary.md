## Expanding this Tutorial World

 Here are some ideas and challenges to continue improving this tutorial world:
• Customize the HUD to give it more personality and style, and adapt it to your
needs.
• Add sound effects and visual effects to add polish when interacting with objects
(the wand, the keypad or the slingshot) or when completing the puzzles.
• Use asset spawning in your managers to spawn in assets when a player joins the
world, instead of having duplicates of all assets prebuilt in the world.
• Build more rooms, mechanics and puzzles using these features. Let your
imagination run wild and build amazing experiences!

 Hopefully, this tutorial has helped you learn how to develop worlds for all
platforms. We are looking forward to seeing what you are capable of building!    ![Nav Logo](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/yE/r/3SoBlk8EqOQ.svg)
