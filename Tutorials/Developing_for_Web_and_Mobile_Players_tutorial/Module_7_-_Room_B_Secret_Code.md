# Module 7 - Room B: Secret Code

 In this module, we create the second puzzle room in the world. To solve the
puzzle, the player must turn over four objects to reveal numeric codes. These codes
must be entered into the keypad in the correct order, after which the closed
exit door opens. These interactions are straightforward to manage in VR. Players can simply grab
objects and rotate them, or your code can check for collisions when a player
pushes a button. On web and mobile, however, we must use the Focused Interaction API to rotate
objects and gather player input (mouse clicks or taps) on a 2D screen. Since this module is lengthy, it's been broken up into smaller units. All units
apply to the Secret Code puzzle room.    ![Nav Logo](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/yE/r/3SoBlk8EqOQ.svg)
