# Create your first world tutorial Overview

Welcome to the “Create Your First World” tutorial.
In this tutorial, you’ll learn how to create a simple game in Worlds. This tutorial has two parts. You can go to either part directly, by clicking the link for part 1 or part 2. Or you can go to Part 1 and continue from there to Part 2 following the link you’ll find there.

* [Part 1](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/get-started/create-your-first-world) shows you how to create a new world, then place an asset in your newly created world, manipulate that asset using the desktop editor before previewing your world, and finally playing in your world on a mobile device.
* [Part 2](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/get-started/create-your-first-world-continued) takes you a step further, and it shows you how to import custom 3D models to your world and write your first script to create unique behavior for the objects in the world. The tutorial then ends with playing the simple game in virtual reality.

## Prerequisites

As with all tutorials for Worlds, this tutorial requires a variety of prerequisites, most of which are also required for creating most aspects of your world. Click on each one for more information:

* [A Meta Horizon Worlds account](https://horizon.meta.com/)
* [Installing the Worlds desktop editor](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/get-started/install-desktop-editor)
* [Basic familiarity with TypeScript](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/typescript/typescript). To enable greater flexibility with the objects you place in your world, you’re going to want to be able to write scripts that tell them what to do. Worlds uses [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), a type-focused version of Java Script for this, and while using scripting is optional, it will definitely add a lot to your world. It requires an IDE for use, such as [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). Some of the tutorials, such as the introductory tutorial, [Create your own world, Part 2](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/get-started/intro-tutorial-part2) include scripting as part of the tutorial.
* (Optional) [An integrated development environment (IDE)](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/typescript/getting-started/adding-an-ide-to-desktop-editor) that’s set up and connected to the desktop editor. While this is optional, it is necessary in order to do scripting in your world. We recommend [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), and it’s the one that is used throughout our tutorials. However, if you’d prefer, you can use another one. For more information on these, see [Tutorial Prerequisites](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/tutorial-worlds/getting-started-with-tutorials/tutorial-prerequisites).
* (Optional) If you want to test your creations in virtual reality (VR), install the [Meta Quest Link](https://www.oculus.com/download_app/?id=1582076955407037) app.
