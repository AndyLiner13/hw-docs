# Module 6 – Summary

Thanks for checking out the NoesisGUI UI Training Tutorial!

You’ve explored the essential mechanics for working with interactive UI in Horizon Worlds, including how to use XAML and TypeScript together to build dynamic, data-driven interfaces.

## What You’ve Learned

* How to set up and import a NoesisGUI sample project
* The structure and workflow of each training station, from static displays to advanced interactive UIs
* How to use data binding and event handling to connect UI elements to TypeScript logic
* Techniques for integrating UI with 3D world objects and real-time data
* Best practices for organizing assets, optimizing performance, and troubleshooting common issues

## Extending the Tutorial

Here are some ideas for how you can build on what you’ve learned:

### Customize and Expand Stations

Modify the provided stations or combine features from multiple stations to create your own unique UI panels and interactions.

### Integrate with Your Own Worlds

Import NoesisGUI assets into your Horizon World and connect them to your own scripts and entities.

### Experiment with Advanced Features

* Add new quest types or inventory items in the Quest Tracker or Item Grid stations
* Create new leaderboard categories or custom reward logic in the Rankings and Tab Navigation stations
* Use DataTriggers and Storyboards for more complex visual feedback

### Build a Complete UI Flow

Combine multiple stations into a single, cohesive user interface for your world—such as a main menu, inventory, quest log, and leaderboard.
