## Access the NPC gizmo

 While you can access and configure the gizmos in the [VR tool](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/vr-creation/getting-started/create-a-new-world-in-horizon), the following steps show you how to access the NPC gizmo from the desktop
editor and add it to the scene pane.
1.  In the desktop editor while in the Build mode, select Build > Gizmos from the menu bar, search for "npc" in the search field.
2.  Select the NPC gizmo and drag it into the scene.
3.  You can now edit the new gizmo properties in the Properties panel.

 For additional tutorials on how to access and use the gizmo, see [Create scripted avatar NPC](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/desktop-editor/npcs/scripted-avatar-npcs/create-scripted-avatar-npc).

## Properties

 The NPC gizmo is an entity. All objects in a world are represented by entities. [Entities](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/reference/2.0.0/core_entity) have their respective properties such as position, rotation, and scale. In the Properties panel, you can edit the gizmo's transformation fields to configure its Position, Rotation, and Scale. For descriptions of the additional NPC gizmo properties, see [NPC gizmo](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/desktop-editor/npcs/npc-gizmo).

# NPC gizmo

 A [Non-Playable Character](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/desktop-editor/npcs/npcs) (NPC) in Worlds is a character that is not controlled by a player but is
instead programmed to perform certain actions or behaviors. NPCs can enhance the
interactivity and immersion of virtual worlds by providing dynamic interactions and
responses to players. They can be used for various purposes. NPCs in Worlds can
be customized and controlled using scripts, allowing creators to define their
behaviors, interactions, and appearances. This customization is often done using
tools like the [NPC gizmo](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/desktop-editor/npcs/npc-gizmo) along with scripting, which enable creators to integrate NPCs into their worlds
and enhance the overall user experience.
