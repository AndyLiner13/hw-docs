## Access the snap destination gizmo

 While you can access and configure the gizmos in the [VR tool](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/vr-creation/getting-started/create-a-new-world-in-horizon), the following steps show you how to access the snap destination gizmo from the
desktop editor and add it to the [scene pane](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/desktop-editor/getting-started/user-interface/UI-panels-and-tabs#scene-pane).
1.  In the desktop editor while in the [Build mode](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/desktop-editor/getting-started/user-interface/operational-modes), select Build > Gizmos from the menu bar, search for "snap destination" in the search field.
2.  Select the snap destination gizmo and drag it into the scene.
3.  You can now edit the new gizmo properties in the [Properties panel](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/desktop-editor/getting-started/user-interface/UI-panels-and-tabs#properties-pane).

## Properties

 The snap destination gizmo is an entity. All objects in a world are represented
by entities. [Entities](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/reference/2.0.0/core_entity) have their respective properties such as position, rotation, and scale. In the Properties panel, you can edit the gizmo's transformation fields to configure its Position, Rotation, and Scale. Apply Orientation controls whether the player's final orientation will be aligned with the
gizmo's orientation. Note: To validate that the snap destination gizmo is working, visit the world with
the snap destination gizmo in [VR](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/vr-creation/getting-started/create-a-new-world-in-horizon). Ensure to set Movement style to Teleport by going to the Worlds app's Settings > Gameplay > Movement style > Teleport. When players use teleport movement, the aiming circle will automatically snap to
the center of the gizmo when the area covered by the gizmo is detected.

# Snap destination gizmo

 The snap destination [gizmo](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/code-blocks-and-gizmos/about-gizmos) is a helper tool used by creators to designate specific locations where
players' avatars can snap into place. When players use teleport movement, the aiming
circle will automatically snap to the center of the gizmo when the area covered by
the gizmo is detected. The following image shows the aiming circle in [VR](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/vr-creation/getting-started/create-a-new-world-in-horizon) when the Movement style is set to Teleport in the Worlds app settings. ![A screenshot of the aiming circle in VR](https://scontent-dfw5-2.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/511130115_750518717486082_3937306918986985171_n.png?_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=e280be&_nc_ohc=_6wQoQQFJqsQ7kNvwFSDn7z&_nc_oc=AdlqceJbw5vZHuQ6k6sx-mClkzFD5zjw3HE7sGeILQfVI6eSXq9rhN084lsJCiG6
