# Spawn point gizmo

## Limitations

 When the entity is teleported to another location, a transition scene may be
included. The use of this gizmo may also affect camera view, player gravity, and
speed.  
## Access and use the spawn point gizmo

 In the Meta Horizon Worlds desktop editor, do the following to access the spawn
point gizmo:
1.  In the desktop editor while in Build mode, select Build > Gizmos from the menu bar, search for "spawn point" in the search field.
2.  Select the spawn point gizmo and drag it into the scene.
3.  You can now edit the new gizmo properties in the Properties panel.

## Spawn point properties

 The spawn point gizmo properties can be configured in the [Properties panel](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/desktop-editor/getting-started/user-interface/UI-panels-and-tabs#properties-pane) of the desktop editor or through [scripting](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/typescript/getting-started/using-typescript-in-horizon-worlds).

## Scripting

 To govern entity lifecycles throughout the game and implement more complex and
dynamic behaviors, use Meta Horizon Worlds [SpawnPointGizmo API](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/reference/2.0.0/core_spawnpointgizmo). See [tutorial worlds](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/tutorial-worlds/getting-started-with-tutorials/tutorial-prerequisites) for complete code samples and follow the [companion documentation](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/tutorial-worlds/getting-started-with-tutorials/access-tutorial-worlds#in-the-desktop-editor) for an in-depth explanation of the implementation details.

# Spawn point gizmo

 In Meta Horizon Worlds, a spawn point refers to a designated location within a
virtual environment where [entities](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/reference/2.0.0/core_entity) such as players, enemies, and NPCs appear or spawn when they enter the world.
These spawn points are important for managing entities' entry and movement within
the game. The spawn point [gizmo](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/code-blocks-and-gizmos/about-gizmos), is a helper tool that you can use to enhance the creation and interactivity of
worlds. In the desktop editor, it is a visual representation of a spawn point
with editable options for adjusting properties such as position, rotation, and
scale. You can also use the [SpawnPointGizmo API](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/reference/2.0.0/core_spawnpointgizmo) to facilitate the management of spawn points such as [respawn](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/mhcp-program/community-tutorials/codeblocks-to-typescript#simplerespawnscriptts). Additionally, when developing for mobile and web platforms, the spawn point
gizmo can be configured to control [player camera's point of view](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/tutorial-worlds/developing-for-web-and-mobile-players-tutorial/module-4-camera-manager#spawnpoint-camera-control). Note: While you can access and use spawn point gizmo in the [VR tool](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/vr-creation/getting-started/create-a-new-world-in-horizon), this introductory topic to spawn point gizmo focuses on the creator experience
in the [desktop editor](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/get-started/install-desktop-editor).
