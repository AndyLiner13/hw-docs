gizmo:
1.  In the desktop editor while in Build mode, select Build > Gizmos from the menu bar, search for “Door” in the search field.

## Properties

 The door gizmo is an entity. All objects in a world are represented by [entities](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/reference/2.0.0/core_entity). Entities have their respective properties such as position, rotation, and
scale. In the Properties panel, edit the door gizmo’s transformation fields to configure its Position, Rotation, and Scale. Additionally, the door gizmo displays the destination world’s name, its
thumbnail image, and a Change button for changing the destination. To change the door’s destination, click Change. Search for public worlds as the door’s destination. The Visible toggle controls the visibility of the gizmo in the world. ![Door gizmo properties panel](https://scontent-dfw5-3.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/494960168_710920418112579_1665985283251277521_n.png?_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=e280be&_nc_ohc=U2QukJqMTI4Q7kNvwFe8YNA&_nc_oc=AdkJslWJIRiW7-aCzQh3Yvnt9CnzHi_wcHoaH7ROtshc0_uuClHD1CWWA_oYUVUVNoI&_nc_zt=14&_nc_ht=scontent-dfw5-3.xx&_...

## Travel to another world using the door gizmo

 While using the door gizmo, keep in mind of the following:
• Both worlds must be published.
• Ensure to enter the exact name of the destination world.
• Ensure that the two worlds do not have the same name.
• Players need to press the trigger on the door and then press Go to initiate the travel.

 The following outlines the steps to travel to another world using the door
gizmo:
1.  After you’ve configured the door gizmo in the desktop editor, [publish](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/save-optimize-and-publish/publish-your-world) the world. For an example of publishing a world on mobile, see [Play in your world on mobile](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/get-started/create-your-first-world#section-4-play-in-your-world-on-mobile).
2.  Visit the published world with the door gizmo on mobile, web or VR.
3.  Approach the door gizmo and interact with it by clicking the trigger.
4.  Click the Go button on the door gizmo to travel to the linked world. Wait for the new world
to load. This may take a few seconds.
5.  Once the loading is complete, you’ll arrive in the new world and start
exploring.

 The following image shows the player in front of the door gizmo. Pressing the
trigger, and then Go will teleport the player to the designated world. Note: Travel is not supported when you’re in the play mode of the desktop editor. ![Door gizmo in the play mode](https://scontent-dfw5-2.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/494753285_710920421445912_6107526059820057792_n.png?_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=e280be&_nc_ohc=pJMpjSeTEwMQ7kNvwEeltni&_nc_oc=Adkp_kFJBINIXW7KJKRolv-CuajR1toziVxsslcJCktxxFGm_avLqW_6d1hadQqo4BU&_nc_zt=14&_nc_ht=scontent-dfw5-2.xx&_nc_gid=qhMpBgj6...

# Door gizmo

 The door gizmo is part of a suite of tools called [gizmos](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/code-blocks-and-gizmos/about-gizmos), which are designed to enhance the creation and interaction capabilities within
Meta Horizon Worlds. The door gizmo in Meta Horizon Worlds allows you to place a door in the virtual
world, configure its properties to link your world with another published world,
and as a result, enables players to interact with the door and travel from one
world to another. Note: While you can access and use the door gizmo in the [VR tool](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/vr-creation/getting-started/create-a-new-world-in-horizon), this topic focuses on the creator experience in the [desktop editor](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/desktop-editor/getting-started/introduction-to-desktop-editor).
