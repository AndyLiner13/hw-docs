# Dynamic light gizmo

## Limitations

 While using the dynamic light gizmo, there are [limitations](https://github.com/MHCPCreators/horizonCreatorManual/blob/main/HorizonTechnicalDoc.md#dynamic-light-gizmo). For example, the number of lights permitted and its impact on [performance](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/performance-best-practices-and-tooling/unity-performance-designing-a-performant-world).

## Access the dynamic light gizmo

 While you can access and use gizmos in the [VR tool](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/vr-creation/getting-started/create-a-new-world-in-horizon), this topic focuses on the creator experience in the desktop editor.
1. In the desktop editor while in the Build mode, select Build > Gizmos from the menu bar, search for "dynamic light" in the search field.
2. Select the dynamic light gizmo and drag it into the scene.
3. You can now edit the new gizmo properties in the [Properties panel](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/desktop-editor/getting-started/user-interface/UI-panels-and-tabs#properties-pane).

  

# Dynamic light gizmo

## Properties

 The dynamic light gizmo is an [entity](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/reference/2.0.0/core_entity). All objects in a world are represented by entities. Entities have their
respective properties such as position, rotation, and scale. In the Properties panel,
you can edit the gizmo's transformation fields to configure its Position, Rotation, and Scale. Additionally, like the transformation, [Color](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/reference/2.0.0/core_color) can be edited in the UI panel or controlled through scripting. In the Light section, additional properties are available to customize and manage dynamic
lights. The Enabled toggle turns the light on or off. The Color and Intensity fields let you configure the light's appearance and intensity. Light Type specifies the type of light sources such as Point (omnidirectional light) or Spot (cone-shaped light). Falloff Distance specifies the decline in light intensity with distance. Spread specifies the spread of spotlight, which is the width of the light beam. For more information on the dynamic light gizmo properties, see [MHCP creator's manual](https://github.com/MHCPCreators/horizonCreatorManual/blob/main/HorizonTechnicalDoc.md#dynamic-light-gizmo) and the [DynamicLightGizmo](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/reference/2.0.0/core_dynamiclightgizmo) API.

# Dynamic light gizmo

 The dynamic light [gizmo](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/code-blocks-and-gizmos/about-gizmos) allows creators to add dynamic lighting effects such as moving and changing
lights. Some common use cases include enhancement of atmosphere and [highlighting important areas or objects](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/tutorial-worlds/economy-world-tutorial/module-3-configuring-gameplay#configuring-the-apple-spawners). The following image is taken from the [tutorial world](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/tutorial-worlds/getting-started-with-tutorials/access-tutorial-worlds) called [Economy world](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/tutorial-worlds/economy-world-tutorial/module-3-configuring-gameplay) where the dynamic light gizmos are at work. The dynamic light is used to draw
attention to the apple. ![An screenshot of the dynamic light gizmo at work](https://scontent-dfw5-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/505443192_738224338715520_974421412205283361_n.png?_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=e280be&_nc_ohc=HVaruix-WjIQ7kNvwHZSUpQ&_nc_oc=AdksXc8H9JNZWS0gH8IXZ4A2QDXV_wdiDEq-Lv_tw9tFXFEFe3SPnEEXIJJIdn4ZOBg&_nc_zt=14&_nc_ht=scontent-dfw5-1.xx&_nc_gid=Nhzm_J8u4cB_rUFdS87EcQ&oh=00_Afd8oabx6r3iH0g1KujSRS4M_K...
