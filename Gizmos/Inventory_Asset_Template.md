 Note You will need to be a member of MHCP and have accepted the monetization Terms Of
Service in the creator portal in order to create in-world items and currency.
Find out more about monetization [here](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/mhcp-program/monetization/creator-monetization-partner-program). The Inventory Asset Template allows creators to easily list the items a player
owns or can own within a world. The items displayed and their configuration can
be set up using the props element of the included Inventory script. An arbitrary
number of items can be listed here, and if the content is larger than the screen
there'll be a scroll bar for the player to navigate through it. The Inventory Asset Template can be configured to display in-world items created
in the Systems > Commerce menu. For more information on creating in-world items, visit the [In-World Purchase Guide](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/mhcp-program/monetization/meta-horizon-worlds-inworld-purchase-guide#creating-an-item). Behind the scenes, the world inventory stores how many of each in-world item is
owned by each player. While the Inventory Asset Template interfaces with the
world inventory automatically, you can use [World Inventory TypeScript APIs](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/reference/2.0.0/core_worldinventory) to manually query, grant, and consume in-world items in a player's world
inventory.
