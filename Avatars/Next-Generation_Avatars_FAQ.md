# Next-Generation Avatars FAQ

 Q: I understand testing with popular worlds but is it possible to have a test
world which we could also put together, where we can have different lighting,
different attachable, stairs, flying mechanic, climbing mechanic etc. A: To kick off the program, we will only be allowing one world per creator.
However, we may increase the total number of worlds each creator can submit for the
new avatars to be enabled, so please stay tuned. Q: Can we submit a world without participating/updating to PTC? A: At this time, the only way to enable the updated avatars in your world will
be to update to PTC. We will let you know if there is any change to this in the
future.  Q: Is this a test to see if the avatars on your end need work or adjusting? Or a
test to see what it would take for all creators to fix their worlds? A: This test is intended to provide interested creators the opportunity to see
the new Avatars in their worlds. This includes understanding how they will show
up and interact within their worlds or environments, and make any updates or
changes to their worlds ahead of the public launch. Q: But you have still yet to say what you would be doing to the world? A: By signing up for this EA, the team will only be cloning the world you submit
via the Google form and granting you access to test out the updated avatars in
that world. Beyond that, any feedback or questions that you share will be sent
to them to respond/address, as needed.  Q: Hmmm.  What would we need to adjust about our worlds to work with the new
avatars? A: We do not anticipate any major changes or adjustments to be required in your
world(s), however, some areas that you might want to consider reviewing include:
• Attachables
• In-world environments accommodating differently sized Avatars, e.g. doorways
• Lighting
• Skyboxes
 For those that join the early access program, the team will be sharing a few
additional tips/pointers on what to look out for or test out within these areas. Q: Collider and anchor points are my main concern. It was bad enough when I was
having to rebuild every attachable every month... I have so many more now! A: One area of improvement the team has focused on for these updated avatars is
the attachment system. Namely, attachables can be set to scale to fit the body
of an avatar as appropriately as possible. We've also added a new toggleable feature that will automatically scale the size
of attachables with the size of the avatar's torso.  At the same time, given
the infinite variety of shapes and sizes of attachables that can be created, we
still recommend you verify how attachments look in the world. Q: Is there some unspecified impact of these avatars? Do they take up more
“capacity”, i.e. reduce frame rate? A: With the next generation avatars, we targeted the performance profile of the
original avatars, while simultaneously improving overall visual quality and
adding new capabilities. Q: Are avatar colliders changing? A: Colliders will be updated slightly between avatar styles as colliders are
tied to the new rig that’s rolling out with next-gen avatars. Like in the previous
style of avatars, the size and shapes of the colliders will still stay uniform
even if the body meshes and sizes of the avatar vary (i.e. a skinny avatar vs. a
wide avatar will have the same collider boxes).    ![Nav Logo](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/yE/r/3SoBlk8EqOQ.svg)
