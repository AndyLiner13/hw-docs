## Create a new world

- Hover over a world icon and select **Create**.

  Select **Blank World** to start from scratch or choose an example world that comes populated with a variety of premade objects to start from.
- If this is your first world, read the terms of service, then select **Agree** to continue.
- Optionally, rename your world using the onscreen keyboard.
- Select **Create**.

## Clone a tutorial world

To clone a tutorial world:

- Navigate to the **Tutorials** tab.
- Hover over a world icon and select **Start**.

The Intro to Creation world comes with basic objects to [practice building with](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/get-started/using-controllers-in-build-mode). The Script Samples world comes with example scripts to help you learn how to [use code blocks](/hw-docs/VR%20tools/Scripting/Use%20code%20blocks.md).

## Start building

After you create a new world or clone a tutorial world, you’ll enter the unpublished world in [Preview Mode](/hw-docs/VR%20tools/Getting%20started/Preview%20Mode.md). This means you can’t edit or build, and you can move around the same way you do in the rest of Worlds. Preview Mode is how others will see and interact with your world once it’s published.

To build or make any kind of edits to your world, enter [Build Mode](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/get-started/using-controllers-in-build-mode), by pressing **down** on the right controller’s joystick.
