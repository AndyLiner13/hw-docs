  ### Overview

The toggle switches are visually distinct due to their color coding, with active states highlighted in purple and inactive states in gray. The layout suggests a linear progression from inputting basic world details to configuring visibility and access settings.

## About the world ratings survey

* You are required to complete the world ratings survey when you first publish a world and it should be retaken whenever you make significant changes to a world’s content.
* Only those above 18 can publish worlds that contain content covered by the [Horizon Mature Worlds Policy](../Save,%20optimize,%20and%20publish/Worlds%20content%20guidelines.md).
* If the survey doesn’t account for certain aspects of your world content that affect its rating, we may change the rating, unpublish, or remove the world.

## To unpublish a world:

- Go to the **Publish** section of your Creator Menu.
- Tap **Publish Updates** to expand the dropdown.
- Tap **Unpublish**.
- Tap **Next**.

Once a world is published, it will appear in the **Places** section of your Personal Menu and anyone in Worlds will be able to search for and go to it.

You can also continue building in a world even after it’s been published without affecting the experience of anyone who’s currently in your world.

## To update a published world:

- Go to the **Publish** section of your Creator Menu.
- Tap the **Next** icon, then tap **Publish Updates**.

Anyone who’s currently in your world will need to leave and come back in order to see the updates.
