### Raycast

 In VR, players interact with the UI panels through raycast from their
controllers. By default, raycast is automatically enabled when a player is within a
certain distance of the UI panel. You can disable raycast and customize the raycast
distance. When raycast is disabled, the UI panel no longer receives the raycast input
events. As a result, the player can no longer interact with the panel. For example,
no `Pressable` components will work properly.  
### Raycast distance

 Raycast distance controls the distance within which a player can interact with
the UI panel. By default, the value is 3. We advise not to set the raycast
distance greater than 10. While there's no strict upper limit for this setting, having
a larger raycast distance across multiple UI panels could negatively impact the
performance. These raycast settings only affect the player experience in VR and are unused
for web and mobile experiences.

### Mipmap

 By default, certain UI panels might have aliasing problems and appear pixelated
when viewed from a far distance. This can be particularly undesirable when the
UI content contains small text. Enabling mipmap can mitigate the issue by
automatically caching some downsampled UI texture.  
### Mipmap bias

 When mipmap is enabled, the mipmap value setting becomes visible. The range for
the mipmap bias is set between -1 and 1, and the default is 0. Enabling mipmap
will slightly affect the performance. If mipmap is enabled for a large number of
visible UI panels, it could negatively impact the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)
performance and reduce frames per second (FPS). Use this feature sparingly only
when needed.

### Focus prompt

 Unlike in VR, players do not interact with UI panels through raycast on web and
mobile platforms. Instead, players see a prompt when they are within a certain
distance from the UI panel, prompting them to press "E" key. If they do, the
camera will zoom in and focus onto the UI panel, and players can interact with the

### Focus prompt distance

 Focus prompt distance controls the distance within which the focus prompt is
shown to a player and the player can zoom in. By default the value is 2.5, but can
be customized with a number that ranges between 0 and 10. The range restriction
is due to performance considerations. These focus prompt settings only affect the player experience on web and mobile
platforms and are unused for VR experiences.

### Moving UI panels that can receive focus from players

 In some cases, if a UI panel is in motion when a player interacts with it, the
UI panel may appear cropped or clipped as the UI panel continues to move after
receiving camera focus. To avoid this, don't move or rotate UI panels that can receive focus from
players.    ![Nav Logo](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/yE/r/3SoBlk8EqOQ.svg)

# Custom UI panel configurations

 This topic describes how you can customize behaviors of the custom UI panel in Properties by configuring settings for Raycast, Mipmap, Focus prompt and related properties. Find these settings by first selecting the Custom UI gizmo entity in Hierarchy. The corresponding configuration settings are then shown in Properties > Visual & Interaction and Web and Mobile. You can use both the desktop editor and the VR edit mode to configure the
settings. The following image shows the custom UI panel configuration settings in the

statically in Properties and cannot be changed at runtime.
