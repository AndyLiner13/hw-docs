# Custom UI gizmo

## Limitations

 The custom UI gizmo can impact [performance](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/performance-best-practices-and-tooling/performance-best-practices/custom-ui-optimization).  
## Access the custom UI gizmo

 The custom UI section has a detailed tutorial on how to [create your first “Hello World” UI panel](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/desktop-editor/custom-ui/creating-a-custom-ui-panel) using the custom UI gizmo.  
 
## Properties

 The custom UI gizmo is an entity. All objects in a world are represented by
entities. [Entities](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/reference/2.0.0/core_entity) have their respective properties such as position, rotation, and scale. In the Properties panel, you can edit the gizmo’s transformation fields to configure its Position, Rotation, and Scale. For additional descriptions of the custom UI gizmo properties, see [Custom UI panel configurations](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/desktop-editor/custom-ui/custom-ui-panel-configurations).  

## Scripting

 Use scripting to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to their UI panels. For
example, scripts can be used to bind data from the world to the UI panel for
displaying a player’s health or score. Another good example involves player
interaction in which scripts can be used to handle user input, such as button clicks,
text entry, or other interactions, and respond accordingly. Completed sample
worlds called Custom UI examples with compiled scripts in [Creation Home](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/desktop-editor/getting-started/creating-a-new-world) are also available. These worlds have [companion documentation](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/tutorial-worlds/custom-ui-examples-tutorial/station-0-setup).

# Custom UI gizmo

 [Custom UI](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/desktop-editor/custom-ui/video-create-performant-custom-uis-in-horizon-worlds) in Worlds is a feature that allows creators to build customizable and
interactive user interfaces in their virtual worlds. This feature enables creators to
animate UIs, create heads-up displays (HUDs), lay out panels, attach buttons, and
dynamically update UI elements based on player actions or other in-world events.
The custom UI system is designed to enhance the player experience by allowing
creators to tailor their worlds for different platforms, including mobile and
desktop. The custom UI feature is great for creating complex UIs and supports a wide
range of UI components. The [custom UI gizmo](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/reference/2.0.0/ui_uigizmo) is a helper tool that lets you use the custom UI feature in your worlds.
