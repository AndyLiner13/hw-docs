## Properties

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **onFocusedInteractionInputEnded**  static  [readonly] | This event broadcasts on the last frame of input when the player ends a touch gesture or mouse click while in [Focused Interaction mode](/hw-docs/Reference/core/Classes/Player.md#enterfocusedinteractionmode).      Signature  ``` static readonly onFocusedInteractionInputEnded: LocalEvent<{         interactionInfo: InteractionInfo[];     }>; ```  Remarks  For more information, see the [Focused Interaction guide](/hw-docs/Mobile%20and%20web/TypeScript%20APIs%20for%20mobile/Focused%20Interaction.md). |
| **onFocusedInteractionInputMoved**  static  [readonly] | This event broadcasts while the player is in [Focused Interaction mode](/hw-docs/Reference/core/Classes/Player.md#enterfocusedinteractionmode) while using touch gestures or mouse clicks. The event fires on all frames of the input except for the first and last frames which instead fire the [PlayerControls.onFocusedInteractionInputStarted](/hw-docs/Reference/core/Classes/PlayerControls.md#onfocusedinteractioninputstarted) and [PlayerControls.onFocusedInteractionInputEnded](/hw-docs/Reference/core/Classes/PlayerControls.md#onfocusedinteractioninputended) events respectively.      Signature  ``` static readonly onFocusedInteractionInputMoved: LocalEvent<{         interactionInfo: InteractionInfo[];     }>; ```  Remarks  For more information, see the [Focused Interaction guide](/hw-docs/Mobile%20and%20web/TypeScript%20APIs%20for%20mobile/Focused%20Interaction.md). |
| **onFocusedInteractionInputStarted**  static  [readonly] | This event fires on the first frame of input when the player starts a touch gesture or mouse click while in [Focused Interaction mode](/hw-docs/Reference/core/Classes/Player.md#enterfocusedinteractionmode).      Signature  ``` static readonly onFocusedInteractionInputStarted: LocalEvent<{         interactionInfo: InteractionInfo[];     }>; ```  Remarks  You can also receive input data from the [PlayerControls.onFocusedInteractionInputMoved](/hw-docs/Reference/core/Classes/PlayerControls.md#onfocusedinteractioninputmoved) and [PlayerControls.onFocusedInteractionInputEnded](/hw-docs/Reference/core/Classes/PlayerControls.md#onfocusedinteractioninputended) events during Focused Interaction mode. For more information, see the [Focused Interaction guide](/hw-docs/Mobile%20and%20web/TypeScript%20APIs%20for%20mobile/Focused%20Interaction.md). |
| **onHolsteredItemsUpdated**  static  [readonly] | This event fires when an item is holstered or unholstered. The purpose of this event is to populate a list of holstered items in a UI panel in order to allow the player to switch between them.      Signature  ``` static readonly onHolsteredItemsUpdated: LocalEvent<{         player: Player;         items: Entity[];         grabbedItem: Entity;     }>; ```  Remarks  The grabbedItem also appears in the items list so this will need to be filtered out when iterating the list of items to display in the UI. |

| **connectLocalInput(input, icon, disposableObject, options)** static | Connects to input events for the local player.      Signature  ``` static connectLocalInput(input: PlayerInputAction, icon: ButtonIcon, disposableObject: DisposableObject, options?: PlayerControlsConnectOptions): PlayerInput; ```  Parameters  input: [PlayerInputAction](/hw-docs/Reference/core/Enumerations/PlayerInputAction.md)  The action to respond to.  icon: [ButtonIcon](/hw-docs/Reference/core/Enumerations/ButtonIcon.md)  The icon to use for the button, on platforms that display on-screen buttons for actions.  disposableObject: [DisposableObject](/hw-docs/Reference/core/Interfaces/DisposableObject.md)  The [DisposableObject](/hw-docs/Reference/core/Interfaces/DisposableObject.md) that controls the lifetime of the connection  options: [PlayerControlsConnectOptions](/hw-docs/Reference/core/Type%20Aliases/PlayerControlsConnectOptions.md)  *(Optional)* Connection options, see [PlayerControlsConnectOptions](/hw-docs/Reference/core/Type%20Aliases/PlayerControlsConnectOptions.md) for defaults.  Returns  [PlayerInput](/hw-docs/Reference/core/Classes/PlayerInput.md)  A [PlayerInput](/hw-docs/Reference/core/Classes/PlayerInput.md) instance that can be used to poll the status of the input, or register a state change callback.

| **equipPreviousHolsteredItem()** static | Equips the previous holstered item if there is one      Signature  ``` static equipPreviousHolsteredItem(): void; ```  Returns  void |
| **getPlatformKeyNames(action)** static | Returns a list of names that represent the physical buttons or keys bound to the specified action.
