## Properties

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **onFocusedInteractionInputEnded**  static  [readonly] | This event broadcasts on the last frame of input when the player ends a touch gesture or mouse click while in [Focused Interaction mode](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/reference/2.0.0/core_player#enterfocusedinteractionmode).      Signature  ``` static readonly onFocusedInteractionInputEnded: LocalEvent<{         interactionInfo: InteractionInfo[];     }>; ```  Remarks  For more information, see the [Focused Interaction guide](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/create-for-web-and-mobile/references-and-guides/how-to-use-focused-interaction). |
| **onFocusedInteractionInputMoved**  static  [readonly] | This event broadcasts while the player is in [Focused Interaction mode](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/reference/2.0.0/core_player#enterfocusedinteractionmode) while using touch gestures or mouse clicks. The event fires on all frames of the input except for the first and last frames which instead fire the [PlayerControls.onFocusedInteractionInputStarted](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/reference/2.0.0/core_playercontrols#onfocusedinteractioninputstarted) and [PlayerControls.onFocusedInteractionInputEnded](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/reference/2.0.0/core_playercontrols#onfocusedinteractioninputended) events respectively.      Signature  ``` static readonly onFocusedInteractionInputMoved: LocalEvent<{         interactionInfo: InteractionInfo[];     }>; ```  Remarks  For more information, see the [Focused Interaction guide](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/create-for-web-and-mobile/references-and-guides/how-to-use-focused-interaction). |
| **onFocusedInteractionInputStarted**  static  [readonly] | This event fires on the first frame of input when the player starts a touch gesture or mouse click while in [Focused Interaction mode](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/reference/2.0.0/core_player#enterfocusedinteractionmode).      Signature  ``` static readonly onFocusedInteractionInputStarted: LocalEvent<{         interactionInfo: InteractionInfo[];     }>; ```  Remarks  You can also receive input data from the [PlayerControls.onFocusedInteractionInputMoved](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/reference/2.0.0/core_playercontrols#onfocusedinteractioninputmoved) and [PlayerControls.onFocusedInteractionInputEnded](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/reference/2.0.0/core_playercontrols#onfocusedinteractioninputended) events during Focused Interaction mode. For more information, see the [Focused Interaction guide](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/create-for-web-and-mobile/references-and-guides/how-to-use-focused-interaction). |
| **onHolsteredItemsUpdated**  static  [readonly] | This event fires when an item is holstered or unholstered. The purpose of this event is to populate a list of holstered items in a UI panel in order to allow the player to switch between them.      Signature  ``` static readonly onHolsteredItemsUpdated: LocalEvent<{         player: Player;         items: Entity[];         grabbedItem: Entity;     }>; ```  Remarks  The grabbedItem also appears in the items list so this will need to be filtered out when iterating the list of items to display in the UI. |
