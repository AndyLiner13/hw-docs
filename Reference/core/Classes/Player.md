```

## Constructors

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **(constructor)(id, entity)** | Creates a player in the world.  ---  Signature  ``` constructor(id: number, entity?: Entity); ```  Parameters  id: number  The ID of the player.  entity: [Entity](/hw-docs/Reference/core/Classes/Entity.md)  *(Optional)* An optional NPC Gizmo entity associated with the player. |

## Properties

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **avatarScale** | The scale of the player's avatar. Change this to scale the player up or down.      Signature  ``` avatarScale: HorizonProperty<number>; ```  Examples  This example demonstrates how to modify the avatar scale of a player when it enters a trigger.  ``` class AvatarScalingExample extends hz.Component<typeof AvatarScalingExample> {   static propsDefinition = {     newAvatarScale: { type: hz.PropTypes.Number },   };    start() {     this.connectCodeBlockEvent(this.entity, hz.CodeBlockEvents.OnPlayerEnterTrigger, (player) => {       player.avatarScale.set(this.props.newAvatarScale);     });   } }  hz.Component.register(AvatarScalingExample); ```  Remarks  Accepts values between 0.05 and 50. The scaling happens with a one frame delay. |
| **backpedalMultiplier** | The multiplier applied to a player's locomotion speed when they are backpedaling.      Signature  ``` backpedalMultiplier: HorizonProperty<number>; ```  Examples  This example demonstrates how to modify the player backpedal multiplier while it is inside a trigger.  ``` import * as hz from 'horizon/core';  class BackpedalMultiplierExample extends hz.Component<typeof BackpedalMultiplierExample> {   static propsDefinition = {     modifiedBackpedalMultiplier: { type: hz.PropTypes.Number },   };    private defaultBackpedalMultiplier: number = 0.825;    start() {     this.connectCodeBlockEvent(this.entity, hz.CodeBlockEvents.OnPlayerEnterTrigger, (player) => {       var extendedPlayer = new hz.Player(player.id);       extendedPlayer.backpedalMultiplier.set(this.props.modifiedBackpedalMultiplier);     });      this.connectCodeBlockEvent(this.entity, hz.CodeBlockEvents.OnPlayerExitTrigger, (player) => {       var extendedPlayer = new hz.Player(player.id);       extendedPlayer.backpedalMultiplier.set(this.defaultBackpedalMultiplier);     });   } }  hz.Component.register(BackpedalMultiplierExample); ```  Remarks  Default value is 0.825. backpedalMultiplier must be a value between 0 and 10. `backpedalMultiplier.set` can be called on any player from any context, but `backpedalMultiplier.get` will throw an error unless it's called from a local script attached to an object owned by the player in question. Using the Orbit, Pan, and Follow camera modes will prevent the user from backpedaling. |
| **deviceType** | Gets the type of device the player is using.      Signature  ``` deviceType: ReadableHorizonProperty<PlayerDeviceType>; ```  Remarks  New device types may be added in the future, so you should handle this property with a switch statement. |

| **index** | The index that identifies the player in the list of all players in the world instance.      Signature  ``` index: ReadableHorizonProperty<number>; ```  Examples  This example demonstrates how to retrieve a `Player` object using a player index.  ``` var playerIndex = player.index.get(); var playerFromIndex = this.world.getPlayerFromIndex(playerIndex); ```  Remarks  When joing a world, each player is assigned an index, which ranges from 0 (the first player) to `Max Players - 1`. Use the index value to keep track of players and get a `Player` object using the [World.getPlayerFromIndex()](/hw-docs/Reference/core/Classes/World.md#getplayerfromindex) method. |
| **isGrounded** | Indicates whether the player is grounded (touching a floor). If a player is grounded then gravity has no effect on their velocity.      Signature  ``` isGrounded: ReadableHorizonProperty<boolean>; ``` |
| **isInBuildMode** | Indicates whether a player is in build mode.      Signature  ``` isInBuildMode: ReadableHorizonProperty<boolean>; ```  Remarks  Build mode means the player is editing the world. The alternative, preview mode, is when they're playing the world. |
| **isJumping** | Indicates whether the NPC is performing a jump.      Signature  ``` isJumping: ReadableHorizonProperty<boolean>; ``` |
| **isMoving** | Indicates whether the player is moving.      Signature  ``` isMoving: ReadableHorizonProperty<boolean>; ``` |

Signature  ``` rootRotation: HorizonProperty<Quaternion>; ```  Examples  ``` class ServerRotate extends hz.Component<typeof ServerRotate> {   static propsDefinition = {     lookAtProp : { type: hz.PropTypes.Entity },   };   start() {     this.connectCodeBlockEvent(this.entity, hz.CodeBlockEvents.OnPlayerEnterWorld, (player: hz.Player) => {       serverPlayer = player;       console.log("Starting interval Server");       this.async.setInterval(() => {         if(serverPlayer != undefined) {           var rootRotation = serverPlayer.rootRotation.get();           console.log("Server: " + rootRotation.toString());         }       }, 5000);     });     this.connectCodeBlockEvent(this.entity, hz.CodeBlockEvents.OnPlayerEnterTrigger, (player: hz.Player) => {       if(this.props.lookAtProp) {         var lookVector = this.props.lookAtProp.position.get().sub(player.position.get());         var newRotation = hz.Quaternion.lookRotation(lookVector.normalize());         player.rootRotation.set(newRotation);       }     });   } } ```  Remarks  When setting, only the yaw component of the input rotation is used, keeping the character upright. |
| **rotation** | The player's facing/head rotation relative to the world origin. For the rotation of the player's entire avatar, see the [Player.rootRotation](/hw-docs/Reference/core/Classes/Player.md#rootrotation) property.      Signature  ``` rotation: ReadableHorizonProperty<Quaternion>; ```  Examples  ``` var headRotation = serverPlayer.rotation.get(); ``` |
| **screenHeight** | Gets the screen height of the screen surface the player is using.      Signature  ``` screenHeight: ReadableHorizonProperty<number>; ```  Remarks  The returned value is the size of the renderable screen height in pixels, and is not guaranteed to match the actual player's device screen width. |
| **screenSafeArea** | Gets the safe area of the screen surface the player is using.      Signature  ``` screenSafeArea: ReadableHorizonProperty<Rect>; ```  Remarks  The returned value is a screen space normalized rectangle, with values ranging from 0 to 1. To get actual safe area, scale it by screen width and height. i.e: `screenSafeArea.scaleBy(screenWidth, screenHeight)` |
| **screenWidth** | Gets the screen width of the screen surface the player is using.      Signature  ``` screenWidth: ReadableHorizonProperty<number>; ```  Remarks  The returned value is the size of the renderable screen width in pixels, and is not guaranteed to match the actual player's device screen width. |
| **sprintMultiplier** | The multiplier applied to a player's locomotion speed when they are sprinting.
