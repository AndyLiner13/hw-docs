# Social Class

Manages the friend system and related social functionality between players in a world.

## Signature

```
export declare class Social
```

## Examples

```
private followerLogging(player1: Player, player2: Player) {
  // Get the number of followers that the local player has in the current world
  Social.getPlayerFollowerCountInWorld(player1).then(count => {
    console.log(Player 1 has ${count} followers in this world.);
  });

  // Check whether or not player 1 is following player 2.  Use getFollowingStatus so we can detect pending follow requests
  Social.getFollowingStatus(player1, player2).then(status => {
    console.log(Player 1 is ${status.toString()} player 2.);

    // If not following, and we don't have a pending follow request, send an invite
    if (status == FollowStatus.NOT_FOLLOWING) {
      Social.showFollowRequestModal(player1, player2)
    }
  });
}
```

## Remarks

You can use this class to send follow requests between players and get follower and following counts for distributing achievements and rewards based on the level of engagement between players in your world.
