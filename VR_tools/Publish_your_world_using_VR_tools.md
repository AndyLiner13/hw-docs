## About the world ratings survey

• You are required to complete the world ratings survey when you first publish a world and it should be retaken whenever you make significant changes to a world’s content.
• Only those above 18 can publish worlds that contain content covered by the [Horizon Mature Worlds Policy](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/save-optimize-and-publish/restrictions-to-worlds-in-horizon).
• If the survey doesn’t account for certain aspects of your world content that affect its rating, we may change the rating, unpublish, or remove the world.

## To unpublish a world:

1. Go to the Publish section of your Creator Menu.
2. Tap Publish Updates to expand the dropdown.
3. Tap Unpublish.
4. Tap Next.

Once a world is published, it will appear in the Places section of your Personal Menu and anyone in Worlds will be able to search for and go to it. You can also continue building in a world even after it’s been published without affecting the experience of anyone who’s currently in your world.

## To update a published world:

1. Go to the Publish section of your Creator Menu.
2. Tap the Next icon, then tap Publish Updates.

Anyone who’s currently in your world will need to leave and come back in order to see the updates.

In order to publish a world, you’ll need to provide pertinent information such as a name, description and thumbnail photo. This information helps people find your world and decide if they’d like to visit it and explore.
