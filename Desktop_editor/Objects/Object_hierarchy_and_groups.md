# Object hierarchy and groups

## Create a parent-child hierarchy between objects

 While it’s not necessary to designate an existing object in the scene as the
parent of a group, any [object in the hierarchy view](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/desktop-editor/hierarchy-window/hierarchy-window-overview#parent-anything-to-anything) can be dragged and dropped onto any other object to create a parent-child
relationship. Alternatively, you can create an intangible [empty object](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/desktop-editor/hierarchy-window/hierarchy-window-overview#empty-objects) as the parent for one or more children. The following steps demonstrates how an
empty object is created to be the parent of selected objects.
1.  Press Ctrl + Click or Shift + Click to select multiple objects. ![Create a hierarchy](https://scontent-dfw5-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/486620414_681803087690979_4488656560382183237_n.png?_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=e280be&_nc_ohc=krmepocwvUIQ7kNvwGu6dH0&_nc_oc=Adkqd5EPY1vlFmUJKVep-rCAFJ3Wgo6zqqpsG-hLKYrJmG4HwtEzx3fNmmTQX7jl-rU&_nc_zt=14&_nc_ht=scontent-dfw5-1.xx&_nc_gid=4ADATJzkBY6o1qg5SRaA7A&oh=00_AfdaOj257icxcTF...
2.  Create an empty object to be the parent of the selected objects: Press Ctrl + G on your keyboard, or right click to select Create parent object from the context menu.

## Add an object to an existing hierarchy

1.  Select the object you want to add to an existing hierarchy.
2.  Click and drag the object to the hierarchy. In the following image, the Sound Recorder is dragged to the Empty Object hierarchy. ![The object is added to the chosen hierarchy](https://scontent-dfw5-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/486610726_681803084357646_8044919782849029886_n.png?_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=e280be&_nc_ohc=zYFhaYID5BgQ7kNvwEueB3l&_nc_oc=AdnJYzipUB0ESHoB8Wa_z12asDktxTY1YSCNAk3tEDRI4Ktpme6MSF_xWCFQHNNQAk4&_nc_zt=14&_nc_ht=scontent-dfw5-1.xx&_nc_gid=4ADATJzkBY6o1qg5SRaA7A...

## Remove objects from a hierarchy

 Objects can be removed from hierarchies using the same drag-and-drop method as
described above. You can also right-click the object you’d like to remove from the hierarchy and
select Unparent selection.

## Unparent all objects in a hierarchy

1.  Select the parent object of the hierarchy.
2.  Right-click the parent object to click Unparent child objects.
3.  All child objects are removed from the hierarchy, and the parent object remains.

## Additional object organizations

 The four procedures explained above can be combined to create additional object
organizations such as the following:
• Add multiple objects to an existing group.
• Remove multiple objects from an existing group.
• Move objects from one group to another group.
• Nest groups.
• Add or remove objects from nested groups.
• Move objects from a nested group to a higher level group.
• Undo or Redo your last operation.

# Object hierarchy and groups

 The Meta Horizon Worlds desktop editor provides you with the ability to combine
objects so you can select, move, rotate, or scale objects as a single unit. This
is achieved through defining object relationships that allow you to set
behaviors, such as [collidable](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/performance-best-practices-and-tooling/performance-best-practices/physics-best-practices#collidable-objects), for all the child objects of the same parent. Additionally, creating nested [parent-child relationships](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/desktop-editor/hierarchy-window/hierarchy-window-overview#features) between objects improves world organization, and object manipulation and
management. Note: While creating parent-child relationships between objects, pay attention to
the location of the [pivot point](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/desktop-editor/hierarchy-window/hierarchy-window-overview#pivot-around-parent-objects) that defines your rotations and scale transformations.
