## Use the Generative AI Assistant Tool

 The Generative AI Assistant Tool can take action in your world handle basic
end-to-end processes during the world building process. You can enable this mode by
selecting Code and act as the mode for the assistant. As an example, by entering the prompt “Make a door that opens when a button is
pressed”, the Generative AI Assistant Tool can take the following actions:
• Find assets in the Asset Library and place them in your world
• Modify entity properties
• Create scripts and connect them to your world
• Instruct you on additional steps needed to adjust editor settings

 You can also regenerate the content by re-submitting your prompt until you get a
satisfactory response. To use the Generative AI Assistant tool, use the following process:

 Currently the Gen AI Assistant is only capable of tasks focused on basic interactivity and basic system prompts. It cannot autonomously complete complex workflows and is limited to mechanics
that Typescript can interact with. Additionally it cannot interact with any of
the additional generators in the Gen AI panel. The following are examples of use cases that the Gen AI Assistant can do and can
help as a framework for interacting with the Gen AI Assistant:
• As a builder, I can ask a “how do I” question and retrieve up to date results
from Horizon documentation to answer my question:
  • How do I interact with Unity Asset Bundles?
  • How do I create my own custom asset?
  • How do I work with animations in Horizon?
  • How do I learn Typescript?
  • How do I implement a Custom UI system in Horizon?
• As a builder, I can ask the AI Assistant to implement basic interactivity /
basic systems:

## Generating TypeScript code snippets

 Note: The Generative AI Creation Tool can only generate code using [version 2 of the Meta Horizon Worlds Typescript API](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/typescript/api-references-and-examples/horizon-typescript-v2-changes). The Generative AI Assistant tool can also generate Typescript snippets for you
to attach to objects in your world. For best results when generating Typescript
APIs, try to keep your scope limited to one API at a time. Responses will occasionally contain [hallucinations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucination_(artificial_intelligence)). This usually happens when there are no supported APIs available for the given
prompt. If a response doesn’t give the expected result, try reframing your prompt to be
more clear and specific. To generate code snippets using the Gen AI Assistant, use the following process:

3. Enter a prompt into the prompt window and click Generate.
4. The Gen AI Assistant will create a sample snippet of Typescript code and provide
details on how to use it. Note: Because this feature is code only, you will still have to follow the steps
provided to use the generated typescript snippet
