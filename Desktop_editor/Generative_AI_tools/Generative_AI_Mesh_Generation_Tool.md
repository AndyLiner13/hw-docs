# Generative AI Mesh Generation Tool

The Generative AI Mesh tool allows you to dynamically generate textured meshes that can then be added to your worlds asset library. This tool helps streamline the process of world and environment building by adding generated meshes of varying sizes & complexities. This document will cover how to:
• Generated small, medium, or large meshes using the GenAI mesh tool
• Save the generated asset to your library
• Add the generated asset to your created world

Prerequisites
• Horizon Desktop editor installed on your PC

Gen AI Tool Availability & RatesAccess to GenAI features is automated and determined based on your location when using the Desktop Editor. If you move from an unsupported location to a supported location or vice versa, there will be a delay in updating your access for GenAI features. Horizon desktop editor's GenAI tools are currently available to users aged 13+ and the Creator Assistant tool is available to users aged 18+. Access to GenAI features is automated and determined based on your location when using the desktop editor.

## Generate a mesh with GenAI Mesh Generation tool

To access the Mesh Generation tool, open the GenAI panel from the top of your Horizon desktop editor. Then select the 3d model option from the available generate options. After selecting the 3d model option, use the following process to generate a new mesh for your world:
1. Use the Model Size dropdown to select either Small, Medium, or Large. The selected model size corresponds to the tricount of the generated mesh. The tricount is the number of triangles that make up the mesh. The larger the model size, the more triangles the mesh will have and, generally, the higher quality the mesh will be.
2. After selecting your model size, enter a prompt into the prompt field and click Generate. The prompt is a text description of the mesh you want to generate.
3. You will be presented with shape options that represent the final generated mesh. Note: This is a preview of possible generated mesh. Until you texture and save the model it will not be added to your asset library.
4. Mouse over the shape option you'd like to generate and select the Texture this model.
5. Once your mesh has finished generated, click Save model. The generated mesh will be added to your My Assets folder in your asset library in the GenAI Assets subfolder.
6. Your newly generated asset will be added to your assets folder. Once its added to your asset library you can drag it into your world, or double click the asset icon to add it to your world.

## Generate a mesh with Mesh Gen 1.1

Mesh Gen 1.1. offers an alternate workflow for generating 3D models for your world. With Mesh Gen 1.1 your prompt will result in the generation of a series of images, providing you with a range of options to choose from. From these generated images, you can select the specific one you'd like to see a 3D model generated from. You can enable Mesh Gen 1.1 by selecting it from the Generation Model dropdown and selecting Mesh Gen 1.1. After selecting Mesh Gen 1.1 use the following process to generate a new mesh for your world:
1. Use the Model Size dropdown to select either Small, Medium, or Large. The selected model size corresponds to the tricount of the generated mesh. The tricount is the number of triangles that make up the mesh. The larger the model size, the more triangles the mesh will have and, generally, the higher quality the mesh will be.
2. After selecting your model size, enter a prompt into the prompt field and click Generate.
3. You will see some images generated for you based on your input prompt. You can select one or more of these images to generate a 3D model from.
4. To generate a 3D model of a generated image, hover your mouse over the image and select Generate a model of this on the image.
5. Once your model has finished generating, you can click Save model to save the generated 3D model to your asset library. The generated 3D will be added to your My Assets folder in your asset library in the GenAI Assets subfolder.
6. Once saved and available you can drag your generated asset from the library into your world to spawn it.
