The Gen AI panel features pre-made sample prompts that you can select to create a demonstration of generated content. These pre-made samples can be immediately used in your world building process. To open and use the Horizon desktop editor's Generative AI tool, use the following process:
1. Select and open your world then click the Gen AI icon on the top toolbar to open the Gen AI panel.
2. The AI Creation Tool panel opens on the right side of the screen.

With the creation panel open, you can generate either typescript or audio for your selected world. For more detailed information on generating script or audio check the Generative AI Creation Code Tool and Generative AI Creation Audio Tool guides.

## Start new chats and view chat history

Once you've generated content using the Gen AI tool you can start a new chat or return to previous conversations. With the Gen AI panel open select the pencil icon to start a new chat. This can only be selected when you've already started generating content. To view previous conversations select the Open chat history button, then select a previous conversation from the list. You can also delete previous conversations from this list by hovering over an entry, then clicking the trash icon.
