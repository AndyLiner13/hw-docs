## Edit Assets

 Note: Following steps reference editing assets through the Horizon Words Creations
interface.
1. To view an asset’s details, click on the asset you uploaded to your folder. The
following video demonstrates this process: ![GIF showing clicking on an asset tile, which opens up a details dialog box
showing "Description", "Tags", "Folder", "File size", "Owner", "Asset ID", and "Last
edited" fields.](https://scontent-dfw5-2.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/453003674_514606357743987_5499500488650383560_n.png?_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=e280be&_nc_ohc=Tm-Ub7BWi7YQ7kNvwFB6nWr&_nc_oc=Adki4AeQz_eh0i6tD2Is7BX23UmV8dx5akEuE5NvkhXi1jusuyPjQWhWFNi2f4TGB4o&_nc_zt=14&_nc_ht=scontent-dfw5-2.xx&_nc_gid=1B1TPV25xLsmx25KKkcwBw&oh=00_AfdU-LoKc16mCJFzrmW1dteav...
2. To edit the asset, click the context menu on the asset tile, or click Edit in the Details view.
3. Modify the name, description, tags, folder, and associated audio file for the
asset: ![Screenshot showing the "Edit sound" dialog box with "Title", "Description",
"Tags", and "Folder" fields and a drag and drop area to replace the sound file.](https://scontent-dfw5-3.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/453091053_514606447743978_5542190667677873274_n.png?_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=e280be&_nc_ohc=laeg12o-6o8Q7kNvwHpC95_&_nc_oc=AdlgX373c4H2VfLa5bjKXqyP7uyctRYMBT-xXE_AmJzMqRp_PtF9mrvqJX2jlo8dbEs&_nc_zt=14&_nc_ht=scontent-dfw5-3.xx&_nc_gid=1B1TPV25xLsmx25KKkcwBw&oh=00_AfcT8q...
 Note: You can replace the audio assets only for assets that you own. After the audio details are added, they are displayed: ![Screenshot showing the audio asset's details dialog box.](https://scontent-dfw5-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/453002228_514606444410645_6473498994597117976_n.png?_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=e280be&_nc_ohc=BToC4_VaxFoQ7kNvwEmAll0&_nc_oc=Adl9Bjyc1uXVAGgmljy_t5XdIVcGkhh65FDOoSrKFU-gdBEVGV13hMuamVrMso02KQE&_nc_zt=14&_nc_ht=scontent-dfw5-1.xx&_nc_gid=1B1TPV25xLsmx25KK...

## Use audio

### Runtime limits

• A maximum of 1024 virtual audio sources can be available at any one time.
• A maximum of 64 audible sounds can be played at any time.
  • If there are more than 64 audio sources, the quietest sounds are muted to limit
the number to 64.
  • If enabled, player-to-player voice-over (VOIP) counts as 1 audible sound source.

### Memory usage

 As soon as an audio asset is instantiated in the world, its referenced audio
data is loaded into runtime memory. This applies to spawned audio or audio entities
in the world at startup.  

### Preview playback

 To preview the audio, select it. In the Properties panel, click Play. You can also preview in your headset. See the following video for a
demonstration of this process:        ![Screenshot of VR showing My Assets pane in the Build menu.](https://scontent-dfw5-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/453002823_514606387743984_4603528703401156022_n.png?_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=e280be&_nc_ohc=MdkKJIBPAAwQ7kNvwGn2MJV&_nc_oc=AdmkYdCmHmrHsLMSktWnFGLA8hDzYankuGrHdaLiqOy061OpKf_uJBrSRf0iazaDjM0&_nc_zt=14&_nc_ht=scontent-dfw5-1.xx&_nc_gid=1B1TPV25xLsmx25KKkcwBw&oh=...

### Audio properties

 When you add a sound into your world, it is encapsulated in an Audio gizmo.
Select the gizmo, and the following properties are displayed in the Properties
panel:
|  |
|  |
| Preview | Use the Play and Stop buttons to preview how the sound asset is presented in the world. Make adjustments to the playback properties of the asset and then retest playing. |
| Play on Start | When enabled, the sound asset is played when the world starts. If Play on Start is disabled, you must manage the playback of this ambient asset through TypeScript. |
| Loop | When enabled, the sound asset is played repeatedly. |
| Volume | Set the volume of asset playback on a scale from 0 to 1. |
| Volume randomness | Sets the randomness of volume around the current Volume setting as the midpoint of the range. Range is 0.00 to 1.00. Example: Setting to 1.00 means that actual volume in Volume +/- 6db, which is an internal limit on randomness. |
| Pitch | You can pitch the general playback of the sound up (positive values) and down (negative values). The pitch is on a scale of -24 and 24 semitones, which is manipulated by changing the speed. 12 semitones -> 1 Octave → 2x speed |
| Pitch randomness | Sets the total range in semitones. Example: Setting this value to 4.00 means that the pitch value is selected at random in the range from (Pitch - 2 semitones) to (Pitch + 2 semitones). |
| Global | When enabled, the asset is played back without any falloff due to distance. |
| Minimum Distance | When Global is disabled, set the minimum distance that a player must be from the sound asset in order to trigger playback. Minimize the minimum and maximum distance values, where possible. |
| Maximum Distance | When Global is disabled, set the maximum distance that a player must be from the sound asset in order to trigger playback. Minimize the minimum and maximum distance values, where possible. Minimum and maximum distance are three-dimensional vector distances. |
| Low-pass cutoff | Frequency in hertz that defines the low-pass cutoff, which accentuates sounds below this frequency and attenuates sounds above it. Default is 20000 hertz. |
| Send Audio Complete | When enabled, an event is sent to all subscribers to indicate when the sound playback is complete. For ambient music, do not enable this option. |

|  |
|  |
| Mono | Channels: 1 | -18 LUFS Maximum Peak Value: <= -1.0dBTP | Sounds effects tied to a location in the world. | Avoid including reverb or spatialization pre-baked into asset files unless for expression/flavor |
| Ambisonic | First-Order Ambisonic Channels: 4 Looping | -40 to -30 LUFS Duration: ~30 seconds | Ambience or general four-channel first-order ambisonic | Ambisonic content should not contain too much broadband noise, which may conflict with spatialized emitters. |
| Stereo | Channels: 2 Looping | -14 to -12 LUFS Maximum Peak Value: <= -1.5dB Duration: 90–120 seconds | Headset-locked content, no spatialization, e.g. Music. | Avoid including lyrics in your music. |
