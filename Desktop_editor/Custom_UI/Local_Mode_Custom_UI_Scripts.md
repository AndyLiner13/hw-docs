## Binding and Callback Behavior

 When you create custom UI locally, the binding and callback behavior is the
same as when you create custom UI in published worlds. You can bind properties
to world state and respond to user interactions using callbacks. For more
information on binding and callbacks, see the [Custom UI API Reference](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/desktop-editor/custom-ui/api-reference-for-custom-ui).

## Visibility

 Custom UI created locally is only visible to the creator in the Desktop Editor.
When you publish your world, the custom UI will be visible to all players. To
make custom UI visible to all players, you must publish your world.
