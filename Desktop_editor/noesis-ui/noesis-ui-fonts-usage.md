# Noesis UI Fonts Usage

Once you have created a project in NoesisUI and added it to your world, you can select a font for the text of your UI. Selecting a font can help contribute to the aesthetics of your world, and improve your user's overall experience. NoesisUI supports various options for applying and managing fonts in your NoesisUI. This allows you to ensure visual consistency across all of your user interface surfaces.

You can set a font for your project using the following XAML attribute:

`FontFamily="Fonts/#Roboto"`

In this specific example, the font file should be placed in the Fonts directory. You can also use multiple fonts via FontFamilies within your XAML. For more information, check the [NoesisGUI TextTutorial page](https://www.noesisengine.com/docs/Gui.Core.TextTutorial.html).
