# Public Assets

  
## Overview

 Public assets is a library of free, publicly available assets that you can
import and try out in your own worlds. Note: Public assets compliment your personal and shared assets in My assets, enabling
you to store all your assets in one place. To import assets from public assets:
1.  Select the Asset Library tab below the scene panel, and then click Public Assets. ![Public Assets section](https://scontent-dfw5-2.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/496757785_719235317281089_113371143035842316_n.png?_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=e280be&_nc_ohc=B9InKfTWER8Q7kNvwEADpOX&_nc_oc=AdmuxWr04IctTr59oFHRzWnqdrIapqwbH4H9zt_0NQa7d1B0cKekgyAGJmDc5FkMtc&_nc_zt=14&_nc_ht=scontent-dfw5-2.xx&_nc_gid=rZR7lSR7lVcgP7n1R8_Dcw&oh=00_AfdaSf-fpZ9yAQQlrJ...
2.  Use the category and creator filters to find assets that you might be interested
in, or use search to find a specific asset. ![Filters for assets](https://scontent-dfw5-2.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/497454803_719235313947756_1141397685952341022_n.png?_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=e280be&_nc_ohc=K5yt4Jhly6oQ7kNvwEI9RN2&_nc_oc=AdmGqebxO7_rN4gdymoCYP-qFbpupy0DbJkTXnaJndcbYzlS_F47JjZy3bzrxg54e7c&_nc_zt=14&_nc_ht=scontent-dfw5-2.xx&_nc_gid=rZR7lSR7lVcgP7n1R8_Dcw&oh=00_Aff9vT46kgJ0slVDQ09vbMmHEFK3UADNlpIj...
3.  You can sort assets by name and date to narrow down your search. ![Sort assets](https://scontent-dfw5-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/497389609_719235270614427_6406505897107058419_n.png?_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=e280be&_nc_ohc=Rcj5CjofG10Q7kNvwFXQQYm&_nc_oc=Adm-RgdYgAtRD7Fan4JvS0Z0tkUNI06LawcW99N4AdTVBhiFxlHuNJvJcYyjbWoemKI&_nc_zt=14&_nc_ht=scontent-dfw5-1.xx&_nc_gid=rZR7lSR7lVcgP7n1R8_Dcw&oh=00_AfeQl9s7lWid0d3qUHXLFPqUCDTXX...
4. Select the asset that you want to import and drag it to your scene. This will
cause an object to spawn from the asset into your scene and appear in the
Hierarchy panel.
5. In the Hierarchy panel, modify the new object to suit your needs.
