# NPCs Overview

## Value of Adding NPCs to Your World

 Creators can integrate NPCs into their world for a variety of purposes. An NPC
can:
• Provide information or quests to guide players through storylines.
• Serve as enemies or obstacles that players must overcome.
• Engage players in conversation, offering dynamic and responsive interactions.
• Add to the game's atmosphere and immersion, making worlds feel more alive.
• Perform actions such as navigating the world, grabbing and using objects, and spawning or
despawning as needed.

### NPC Gizmos

 The NPC Gizmo is the core entity used to create both scripted and AI-powered
Non-Player Characters (NPCs) in Horizon Worlds. Adding the NPC Gizmo to your world
and configuring it is the first step to fleshing out your world with a variety
of NPCs.  
### NPC Animation

 NPC animations allow your NPCs to express various actions and states, making
them increasingly more dynamic and immersive in your world. These can range from
basic, fundamental movements like idle, walk, and run, to specific interactions like attacking, receiving damage, emotes like waving
or celebrating. Animations are controlled through scripting for your NPC
characters.  
### NPC Locomotion

 Setting up NPC locomotion enables your created NPCs to move through your world,
allowing them to navigate to specific positions, follow waypoints, rotate, stop,
or jump. Building navigation for your NPCs is highly recommended for mobile NPCs, which involves defining designated walkable areas and
characteristics for movement within the environment. This ensures your NPCs can safely
and efficiently reach their destinations, avoiding obstacles and correctly
traversing terrain features.  
### NPC Conversations

 Conversations determine how your NPC responds to players in your world. They can
be powered by an LLM as an AI NPC, or controlled entirely via scripts. Adding
conversation elements to your NPCs in the next step in building an engaging and
interactive world.  
### NPC Library

 The NPC library offers pre-configured NPC characters that can be added to your
world. These characters can be found in the Asset Library and are ready to be added into your world by dragging them in. These NPCs
either come with pre-defined animations, or are examples of features like AI Speech
capabilities.  
### NPC Tutorial

 NPC Tutorials are educational resources and sample worlds designed to help
creators configure and add NPCs to their worlds. These tutorials and samples
illustrate a range of functionalities available when creating and configuring NPCs. A
primary learning tool is the "NPC Examples world," available in the Creation Home's Tutorials section, which provides practical
demonstrations and accompanying scripts.    ![Nav Logo](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/yE/r/3SoBlk8EqOQ.svg)

enrich a player's time in your world by offering dynamic and interactive
experiences. NPCs added to your world can either be scripted entities set to follow
predefined behaviors and animations, complex AI-driven characters capable of
dynamically interacting with users in your world, or pre-built NPCs with defined
