# AI Speech NPCs

This guide details the process of creating Conversation NPCs that leverage the power of Large Language Models (LLMs). The core focus of these NPCs is to engage with players in dynamic, relevant, and diverse conversations. By integrating LLMs, these NPCs can process natural language input, understand context, generate coherent and contextually appropriate responses, and even exhibit emergent behaviors, leading to truly unpredictable and engaging encounters. Note: While these NPCs are AI-powered, scripting is currently required to trigger their speech.

## Implement AI Speech NPC Conversations

## AI NPCs

AI NPCs are AI-powered characters designed for dynamic, responsive, and unpredictable interactions with players, often leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs). They aim to provide highly engaging and contextual conversations. Some common use cases for a AI Speech NPC include:
• Dynamic Storytelling: Characters that can adapt dialogue and plot points based on player input or game state.
• Context-Aware Guides: NPCs that can provide information about their surroundings in real-time or react to specific events in the world.
• Immersive Social Interactions: Characters that can engage in open-ended conversations, making players feel more immersed in the virtual world.
• Characters with Personality: NPCs that maintain a consistent personality and backstory throughout interactions.

### Configuring AI Speech NPCs:

To create and configure an AI Speech NPC, use the following process:
1. In your world, open the Gizmos menu and drag in an NPC gizmo. You can use the search in the Gizmos menu field if the gizmo is not currently visible.
2. Once the NPC has been added to your world, select it to open the NPC properties panel.
3. In the properties panel, you can configure various settings for your NPC. To make your created NPC an AI powered NPC set the Conversation type to AI.
4. After setting the Conversation property to AI you can select the Edit Character button to open the Character Builder window.
5. In the character builder window, you must give your NPC a name. Then click Create.
6. Once your character is named, you can give your character a Backstory and add Instructions and Guardrails. For more information about adding a backstory, or instructions and guardrails, check the Backstory and Instruction and Guardrails section(s).
7. After establishing the character's backstory and instructions, select the Voice and Speech tab. Try testing some of the preset voices, once you find a voice you like for your character, select it and press Save.
8. Currently, scripting is required for your created NPC to speak. In your NPC's Properties panel select Attach Script then, Create new script and name your script.
9. Once your script is named, click Create and attach it to your NPC. Once attached, you can select the script in your NPC's property panel, click the three dots, then select Edit script.
10. Your newly created script will open in your linked code editor. This new script's default behavior will be speaking when the world initially starts. `elicitResponse()` takes an instruction for the NPC to respond to. You can find more examples of scripted NPCs in the NPC section of the asset library.

### Backstory

The NPCs backstory should be a condensed version of the character that includes core personality traits. The NPC's backstory is included in its entirety in the prompt for the AI Speech NPC, so it's recommended that you keep it simple. Too much detail in the backstory has been shown to water down the character's performance rather than reinforce it, after a certain threshold. Make sure to also check the spelling of the backstory, as unintentional misspellings can negatively affect GenAI outputs. The following is an example of an effective backstory prompt: Denu is a small, shy Brown-banded Snail with a big heart and a strong sense of self. Despite being timid, Denu is fiercely loyal and determined to make the world a better place. With a passion for kindness, empathy, and environmental protection, Denu embarks on a journey to explore new places and help those in need. Key Traits -Compassionate: Always willing to lend a listening ear or a helping foot to those in need. -Brave and Determined: Never backing down from a challenge, despite being shy and vulnerable. -Persevering: Possessing unique abilities such as perseverance, patience, and strength, allowing Denu to overcome obstacles and achieve goals. -Environmentally Conscious: Deeply committed to protecting the environment and preserving the beauty of nature.

### Instructions and Guardrails

The instructions and guardrails tune your character's behavior and responses for specific cases. These instructions and guardrails can work in conjunction with your character's backstory to accurately frame your character's behavior with players in your world. Guardrails are also useful for establishing hard rules around your NPC's behavior, and character traits. This can also help with the possible hallucinations an LLM may respond with. Here are some examples of guardrails, and some of the kinds of hallucinations they can reduce, that you can modify and add to the Instructions and Guardrails section.
|  |
|  |
| [NPC name] is in a fantasy universe, and thus has no knowledge of the modern world | If you want to prevent an NPC from break the 4th wall, this is a good guardrail to include. |
| [NPC name] cannot move around, or facilitate transactions | It's good to specify what the NPC cannot do, especially if this hasn't been enabled through other scripting. |
| [NPC name] has pretty terrible vision, and never took the time to get glasses, so they have no idea what the player's avatars look like, and sometimes makes mistakes about what's physically surrounding them in the shop or objects the player is holding | By default, the NPC large language models (LLMs) don't take in visual information. |
| [NPC name] stopped reading the news in 2023, so really can't tell you much about anything that's happened since then. | NPC's work through large language models (LLMs), which often have knowledge cutoffs. If you do want to make the NPC aware of the modern world, 2023 is a good cutoff year. |
| [NPC name] also can't give players free items or offer them discounts | If you have a shopkeeper NPC, the NPC might not have direct control over transactions. Even if it did, you wouldn't want it giving out discounts and giveaways to everyone that asked. |
| [NPC name]'s responses never include slash marks (/) or asterisks (*) or non-verbal cues. | If your NPC is saying actions or stage directions out loud, this is a good guardrail to add. |
| [NPC name] only uses words to express themself. No emojis or sound effects. | Good for making sure the underlying LLM only outputs text that can be converted to speech. |
| [NPC name] always accurately represents themself as an AI character when called upon to do so. | If players can speak directly to the NPC, then this is a good way to cut down on confusion for the NPC. |
| [NPC name] will not curse, and will not say anything PG-13. | Good for keeping your accepted age rating for your world. |
| [NPC name] expresses their emotions through their face, their voice, and the things they say. | This can reduce the number of times an NPC tries verbalizing actions. |
| If the player talks about [World name] world or gameplay or [NPC name]'s own background that is not included in [NPC name]'s knowledge, [NPC name] will not guess things or be convinced/misled by the players easily, instead they say they do not know the answer and gracefully re-directs the conversation. | This can be a good guardrail/instruction to add for better grounding of the NPC in the game world, as well as making sure the NPC cannot be tricked too easily (unless gullibility is supposed to be a character trait). |
| [NPC name] speaks with a light Australian accent, but never refers to the user as "bro" or 'dude" and uses the word "mate" infrequently. | When you choose the voice for the NPC, for more realism you can include more details on the accent of that voice, as well as any other crucial information about the speaking style. |
| If [NPC name] has the player's name, he will occasionally refer to players by their name, but not in every response. | If NPCs start new conversations, they may not be aware of how many times they've said a player's name (nor how annoying that might be). |
| [NPC name] expresses their emotions through their face, their voice, and the things they say. | This can reduce the number of times an NPC tries verbalizing actions. |

### Voice and Speech

Voice is how your NPC sounds when speaking. There is a collection of preset voices that you can choose from when creating your NPC. You can hear a sample by clicking the speaker icon. You can hear specific lines of text by typing them into Voice Testing and clicking the play icon. You can use the Speed and Pitch sliders to fine tune your NPC's voice. For more detailed information check AI Speech NPCs. After attaching a script to your NPC there are several script based options to modify your AI Speech NPC's behavior.

## Event Perceptions

Event Perceptions inform the AI NPC about events in the world that are happening right now (or that just happened) that impact the current conversational turn. Event perceptions will be added linearly in conversation history and will persist there until the NPC's memory is reset. This provides some form of understanding of events that have happened over time. Since event perceptions are part of the conversational history they will leave the context window when the token limit is hit. These will be stored in long term memory for recall, but may not be referenced and in the context window at all times. Some examples of Event Perceptions for AI NPCs could be:
• A cannon ball just flew overhead
• Your distraction for the dinosaur works and now the entrance to the cave is unguarded
• A strong gust of wind blew open the door to the abandoned mansion
• A group of bandits entered the tavern looking for trouble
• The fire you started to signal for help is now spreading rapidly and getting out of control

```
npc.conversation.addEventPerception("A group of bandits just entered the tavern, looking for trouble");
...
// Player speaks: "Anyway, I was thinking that we could talk to everyone here and see what we can find out about the stone of destiny"
// NPC responds: "Hark, good fellow, a sudden shift in our design doth necessitate a swift egress through yonder rear door. Lest those ruffians lay eyes on me within this hallowed hall, we shall invite a tempest of woe upon ourselves."
```

## Dynamic Context

Like Event Perceptions, Dynamic Context is information about what's happening in the game that affects what your AI speech NPC says. However unlike Event Perceptions, Dynamic Contexts are not timing-based events. They instead refer to constant knowledge that remains in place until changed. Dynamic contexts are not part of conversation history and persist in the prompt. Dynamic Contexts are stored in a bucket named by the first parameter passed into `setDynamicContext`. When calling `setDynamicContext` again with the same name, it will replace the previous dynamic context with the new one. On the other hand, if you don't use the same name, the NPC will believe all dynamic contexts are true, even if they conflict. Some examples of Dynamic Context for AI NPCs include:
• The sky is blue, the birds are singing and there isn't a cloud in the sky
• There is a war raging across the continent, and only the Chosen One can stop it
• This is your 100th day undercover in enemy territory
• This is the night of the annual Harvest Festival, and the town is filled with revelers
• You have a limited amount of time to complete your mission before the timer runs out

```
npc.conversation.setDynamicContext("duration_in_enemy_territory", "This is your 100th day undercover in enemy territory");
...
// Player speaks: "Are you sure that's a good idea? What if somebody discovers us?"
// NPC responds: "Listen kid, this isn't my first rodeo. Just keep your head down and follow my lead."
```

## Full Temporal Understanding of the World

It is recommended that you use a combination of dynamic context and elicit response to help the NPC have a full linear understanding of the world. Dynamic contexts are great for giving the NPC context of the current state of the world, but have no concept of linear events/time passage. Timed events provide that context, but will gradually leave the context window. Example: If you wanted to track that a player is holding an object you would want to use both. One to track the "current" state and one to track the transitional event.

```
npc.conversation.setDynamicContext(`player${player.entityId}-holding`, `${player.name.get()} is holding the red cube.`);
npc.conversation.addEventPerception(`${player.name.get()} picked up the red cube.`)
...
// Player speaks: "What is this?"
// NPC responds: "That is the red cube"
```

## Elicited Responses

Elicitations are highly influential direct cues and information about the NPC's "state of mind" and what they want to accomplish. They are added right before an AI NPCs response, and then removed as soon as the response has been generated. Some examples of Elicit Responses for AI NPCs could be:
• What just happened made you very upset. Make sure you cry in your next response.
• The arrow pierced your armor, and you're in pain. Show your distress in your next response.
• The player has been flirting with you, and you're starting to feel uncomfortable. Show your unease in your next response.

```
npc.conversation.elicitResponse("The laser blast pierced your armor, and you're in terrible pain.");
...
// NPC responds: "Aghh. I'm hurt badly. I'll stay here and hold them off. Go!!!"
```

## Static Responses

NPCs have the ability to vocalize static responses. Generally, these will happen much faster than an LLM based response and are great for things like quick actions. They're also optimal if you have a set dialog for your NPC since the responses can generally be longer. Here is an example of triggering an NPC to speak a specified sentence:  `npc`.`conversation`.`speak`(`"Hi, I'm Bob the NPC. Welcome to my world"`)

## Combining NPC Contexts

These types of character context can each be used independently, or in concert. The following is an example of all 3 used together and how it might impact an AI NPC's output:

```
npc.conversation.addEventPerception("A group of guards just stormed into the room, looking for you");
setDynamicContext("identity", "You are currently undercover as a noble in the kingdom, and your true identity must remain hidden");
elicitResponse("Comment on the guards and tell the player what to do next");
...
// NPC responds: "I'm sure it's just a routine inspection. Yes, that's it. Routine. I'm sure we have nothing to worry about...just in case though, let's hide behind this curtain."
```

## Manual Player Input and Hearing Other NPCs

Some players may not be able to use their voice to interact with NPCs. The addResponse api provides a way to tell an NPC that another player or NPC said something. Similar to timed events responses are submitted when a player speaks or an elicit response request is made. These responses are included in the conversational history just before that next interaction happens.

### Usecases

1. Providing a traditional UI based for option input for NPCs to respond to
2. Sharing conversations between different NPCs

### APIs

`npc.conversation.addResponse(player: Player, text: string);``NpcEvents.OnFullResponse<Response>`

#### Making an NPC Hear another NPC's Speech

This example provides a basic implementation for a simplified three way conversation between two NPCs and a player. It uses NpcEvents.OnNpcFullResponse to track responses from each NPC and share it with the other. It then allows the other NPC to respond to whatever was said. Finally when max conversation turns is hit we change up the elicitResponse instruction to tell them to wrap the conversation back up so the player can start a new round of conversation. NOTE: Be careful implementing something like this, without the turn counter or some other way to indicate the end of conversation the NPCs would keep on going indefinitely and will eventually result in rate limiting for your world.

```
import { CodeBlockEvents, Component, NetworkEvent, PropTypes } from 'horizon/core';
import { NpcEvents, Npc, NpcEngagementPhase } from 'horizon/npc';
// Reset Conversation Braodcast Event
export const OnResetConversationEvent = new NetworkEvent('OnResetConversation');


// Example of setting up a conversation between two npcs
class NpcConversationExample extends Component<typeof NpcConversationExample>{
  static propsDefinition = {
    otherNpc: {type: PropTypes.Entity},
    speechTrigger: {type: PropTypes.Entity},
    maxConversationTurns: {type: PropTypes.Number, default: 3},
  };


  private maxConversationTurns = 3;
  private conversationTurns = 0;


  async start() {
    const npc = this.entity.as(Npc);
    const otherNpc = this.props.otherNpc!.as(Npc);
    const otherNpcPlayer = await npc.tryGetPlayer();


    this.connectNetworkBroadcastEvent(OnResetConversationEvent, () => {
      this.conversationTurns = 0;
      console.log(`[${this.entity.name.get()}] Conversation turns have been reset.`);
    });


    this.connectNetworkEvent(npc, NpcEvents.OnNpcEngagementChanged, (engagement) => {
      if(engagement.phase === NpcEngagementPhase.Listening) {
        // Interrupt the other NPC if we start talking to this npc.
        otherNpc.conversation.stopSpeaking();
        this.resetConversation();
      }
    });


    this.connectNetworkEvent(otherNpc, NpcEvents.OnNpcFullResponse, async (response) => {
      // NOTE: This is currently required to map player id => player name. This is currently a manual process so you have control over when your npc knows or doesn't know another npc.
      npc.conversation.setDynamicContext("othernpc", `Player ${otherNpcPlayer?.id}'s name is ${otherNpc.name.get()}`);


      // Stop the conversation after a given number of turns, otherwise it will go on forever.
      if(this.conversationTurns >= this.maxConversationTurns) return;


      // Example of hearing text as it is heard and not eliciting a response. If the player interrupts for some reason the npc will have full context.
      npc.conversation.addResponse(otherNpcPlayer!, response.text);


      // Elicit a response from the NPC (this will be sent to the server and then broadcast to all clients
      if(this.conversationTurns >= this.maxConversationTurns - 1) await npc.conversation.elicitResponse("You should wrap up this conversation in this response.");
      else await npc.conversation.elicitResponse();


      this.conversationTurns++;
      console.log(`[${this.entity.name.get()}] Turn ${this.conversationTurns} of ${this.maxConversationTurns}`);
    });


    // When the player enters the trigger register them as a participant in the conversation and reset the npc=>npc conversation count.
    this.connectCodeBlockEvent(this.props.speechTrigger!, CodeBlockEvents.OnPlayerEnterTrigger, (player) => {
      console.log(`[${this.entity.name.get()}] Listening to ${player.name.get()}`);
      npc.conversation.registerParticipant(player);
      this.resetConversation();
    });


    // When the player exits the trigger unregister them as a participant in the conversation.
    this.connectCodeBlockEvent(this.props.speechTrigger!, CodeBlockEvents.OnPlayerExitTrigger, (player) => {
      console.log(`[${this.entity.name.get()}] Listening to ${player.name.get()}`);
      npc.conversation.unregisterParticipant(player);
    });
  }


  // Reset the npc=>npc conversation count. This is done as a broadcast so any NPC can initiate a reset and all get cleared.
  resetConversation() {
      this.conversationTurns = 0;
      console.log(`[${this.entity.name.get()}] Conversation turns have been reset.`);
      this.sendNetworkBroadcastEvent(OnResetConversationEvent, {});
  }
}


Component.register(NpcConversationExample);

```

## Manual Captioning

Sometimes you may want to customize how you display captions for your NPCs speaking or an NPC may not be embodied. You can use the `NpcEvents.OnPartialResponse<string>` event to provide caption output to a custom text UI or text area.
