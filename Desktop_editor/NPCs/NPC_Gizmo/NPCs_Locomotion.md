# NPCs Locomotion

Effective locomotion allows your NPCs to move realistically and interact dynamically with your world, whether they are performing pre-defined actions or responding to complex AI logic. Locomotion helps make your NPCs perform actions like walking, turning, and jumping from scripting via Typescript. This style of direct locomotion can be controlled with methods like `moveToPosition()`, `rotateTo()`, and `jump()`.

## Set up direct NPC movement

Setting up Direct NPC movement provides immediate, controllable locomotion without requiring a NavMesh setup. These APIs are ideal when you require direct control over your NPC's movement.

### Sample

```
import * as hz from 'horizon/core';
import { Npc, NpcPlayer, NpcLocomotionResult } from 'horizon/npc';

// Example component - you can name this whatever fits your use case
class NPCMovementExample extends hz.Component<typeof NPCMovementExample> {
 static propsDefinition = {
   npcEntity: { type: hz.PropTypes.Entity },
   targetEntity: { type: hz.PropTypes.Entity },
 };

 private npc: Npc | null = null;
 private npcPlayer: NpcPlayer | null = null;

 async start() {
   this.npc = this.props.npcEntity?.as(Npc);


   if (this.npc) {
     this.npcPlayer = await this.npc.tryGetPlayer();
     this.performBasicMovement();
   }
 }

 private async performBasicMovement() {
   if (!this.npcPlayer || !this.props.targetEntity) return;
   const targetPosition = this.props.targetEntity.position.get();


   // Basic movement with default options using the actual NpcPlayer API
   try {
     const result = await this.npcPlayer.moveToPosition(targetPosition);


     if (result === NpcLocomotionResult.Complete) {
       console.log('NPC reached destination successfully');
       // Perfect for triggering follow-up actions like:
       // - Starting dialogue
       // - Playing animations
       // - Activating game objects
       // - Updating quest states
     } else {
       console.warn(`Movement failed with result: ${result}`);
     }
   } catch (error) {
     console.error('Movement error:', error);
   }
 }
}

hz.Component.register(NPCMovementExample);
```

If using a Nav Mesh for your NPC, here are some additional core concepts to know before setting up your NPC for navigation: Navigation volume gizmo The navigation gizmo is the primary building block for designing navigation meshes. The box-shaped gizmo allows you to define which areas of your world should be used when generating a navigation mesh. By placing a navigation gizmo in your world, the navigation mesh generation process recognizes the gizmo's boundaries and identifies any walkable areas within that space. Conversely, you can set a gizmo to inclusion or exclusion mode. Exclusion mode cuts out an area from the navigation mesh. You can also make gizmos profile-specific, meaning you can design profile-specific walkable areas, exclude agents from a certain area, and so on. Navigation mesh (Nav mesh) A navigation mesh is a 3D polygonal mesh that defines sections of an environment that an agent can traverse. A world can have multiple navigation meshes for different types of AI agents, dictated by the navigation profiles you define. Each profile has an associated navigation mesh, which can be queried at runtime through the TypeScript API. Agent An agent is an entity that queries and traverses a navmesh. Agents are typically NPCs, but they can also be player characters depending on the game's implementation. There is no specific Agent class or code structure; it is a general term that refers to entities that query and use the navigation mesh to function. Navigation profile A navigation profile defines properties that describe the agent traversing the world. These properties tell the navigation mesh how tall or wide the agent is, as well as details such as the maximum slope angle that can be climbed. These details not only impact the mesh generation, but also the paths calculated at runtime. You can configure the following properties in a navigation profile: ‚Ä¢ Radius: The closest the center point of an agent can get to a wall or ledge. ‚Ä¢ Height: The minimum height needed for an agent to move through an area. ‚Ä¢ Max slope angle: The maximum incline an agent can move up in degrees (between 0 and 60). ‚Ä¢ Step height: The maximum height an agent can step up.

## Build navigation for NPCs

Before beginning to build and configure navigation for your NPCs, first you should ensure that the correct APIs are enabled in your world environment. Select Scripts from the top menu bar, then click the options icon. Select API from the menu and ensure that horizon/navmesh is enabled. \ After verifying that the horizon/navmesh API is enabled, you can begin building navigation for your NPCs.

### Build a navigation profile

Use the following process to setup and generate nav meshes that can be accessed with the NavMesh API:
1. In the Systems menu, click Navigation to open the Navigation Profiles menu. This menu lists any navigation profiles defined for your world and allows you to create new ones.
2. Click the + button to begin creating a new profile. ![Create profile](https://scontent-dfw5-3.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/544925662_810235174847769_5841180415906125287_n.png?_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=e280be&_nc_ohc=piiWhbSVOUAQ7kNvwFKvTAu&_nc_oc=AdmGqGHV7HAl8YO0GCqne8NPiJL1Qh0etK4nnPcfzgpiaVoovRC5BN1Pz--r97Ea9GE&_nc_zt=14&_nc_ht=scontent-dfw5-3.xx&_nc_gid=tTOwbShFdzCyIhJ_gQMFdw&oh=00_AfcfsOUx...
3. In the Navigation Profiles window, click the Create Profile button to begin creating a new agent profile. The agent profile options are as follows:

 |Property|Description| |---|---| |Agent Height|How high an area needs to be in order for the NPC to navigate underneath it.| |Agent Radius|How wide an area needs to be in order for the NPC to be able to walk through it.| |Agent Slope|How steep a slope an NPC can walk up.| |Step Height|How high an obstacle needs to be before it will block the NPC. For example, a small stone would be easy for the Android to step over and a bigger rock might be more difficult or might actually obstruct their path.These properties could be different for the Android as opposed to the Chicken. It would be able to step over a smaller stone.|
1. Once finished click Create to create and save your profile. Your created profile will be added to the Navigation profiles window. ![Navigation profiles window](https://scontent-dfw5-2.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/546839636_810235194847767_5915781040095956488_n.png?_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=e280be&_nc_ohc=gEk8k5OmVTQQ7kNvwFkddF9&_nc_oc=AdnXsWCajIDpbRsq4i9HdnawB2W328LxtvzTNaOXYksZNnIIyNIzSFofL4op2W0tYjU&_nc_zt=14&_nc_ht=scontent-dfw5-2.xx&_nc_gid=tTOwbShFdzCyIhJ_gQM...

### Add navigation volume for NPCs

After creating a profile, you can add the Navigation volume gizmo to your world to define which areas are navigable. To do so use the following process:
1. After adding an NPC to your world and choosing its embodiment, open navigate to Build > Gizmos and select Navigation volume. The Navigation volume will be used in order to determine what areas are navigable by the NPC. So you want to stretch this box out to cover the entire floor of what you want to be navigable. ![Navigation volume gizmo](https://scontent-dfw5-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/544893966_810235171514436_8751560581100777950_n.png?_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=e280be&_nc_ohc=k2gliJhN4KcQ7kNvwHbNieO&_nc_oc=AdmenxesbSrrE70BJsMN0gwB-AIv6rt5jjcrHHb8An5fabHCJtz1NyZR1DrB5TDeJdw&_nc_zt=14&_nc_ht=scontent-dfw5-1.xx&_nc_gid=tTOwbShFdzCyIhJ_gQMFdw&oh=00_Affr0HhEi...
2. Once your navigation volume is added and you can configure the Volume Type which controls whether it is an Inclusion or Exclusion navigation volume. Setting the volume to Exclusion cuts the covered area out from any generated navigation mesh. ![Navigation volume settings](https://scontent-dfw5-2.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/546150608_810235164847770_2891489873504620929_n.png?_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=e280be&_nc_ohc=XIv9vcfrRroQ7kNvwHt_8Ig&_nc_oc=Adl3pP5pYVfXpnBk5mD0SX60d8IqGHLocj0bqwQgUvCftmKDAd3QLEGf0TxFWyQ21-Q&_nc_z...
3. Next, set what the created navigation volume applies to. Use Navigation Profile and select a created navigation profile or set to All to apply to all entities. ![Navigation profile](https://scontent-dfw5-2.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/545387234_810235201514433_2287177445923012240_n.png?_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=e280be&_nc_ohc=nbmpeRPp3QcQ7kNvwF8NkqH&_nc_oc=AdkleyA9MaRCysX8avROklehZD5rVpImWt4xeJbLiDyX4MWC74PenmB3UeqHY-rKHPk&_nc_zt=14&_nc_ht=scontent-dfw5-2.xx&_nc_g...

 Exclusion is useful for in-world assets that shouldn't affect NPC navigation like doors.

### Build the navigation meshes

Once you have created and defined profiles and navigation volume gizmos for your world, the next step is to build the meshes for each profile. Alternatively, this is called "baking" the navigation mesh. Navigate to Systems > Navigation and select Bake All. ![Bake All](https://scontent-dfw5-2.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/546228971_810235188181101_1142415572734745848_n.png?_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=e280be&_nc_ohc=R0JsbNWAJBQQ7kNvwGUtw2l&_nc_oc=AdnCKqceKIFDVXyf2Hgz1hOvjlPbE6LoWq4O0yR-lTQEVib417oTntE7eXHk8iq6-S0&_nc_zt=14&_nc_ht=scontent-dfw5-2.xx&_nc_gid=tTOwbShFdzCyIhJ_gQM...

 After selecting Bake All you should see the navigation meshes built for your world. If it appears that nothing happened when building the navigation mesh, you likely need to enable the in-editor previews. Hover over each profile and ensure the visibility indicator is set to üëÅ by clicking the relevant button.
