control to position objects based on their pivot point, or make the objects in
your scene snap to a specific coordinate value.
6. [Local, Global, and Transform pivot](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/desktop-editor/objects/object-manipulation#global--local-coordinate-space) toggles the coordinate space that object manipulators are based on.
