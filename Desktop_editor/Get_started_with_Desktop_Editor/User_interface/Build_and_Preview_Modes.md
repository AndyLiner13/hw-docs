# Build and Preview Modes

 Build mode and Preview mode let you to switch back and forth between building your world in the
desktop editor and seeing how it looks to users. The desktop editor loads in Build mode by default when you open it. This enables you to immediately start
building a world, creating a scene, or placing objects. You can then use Preview mode to test-run your world, experiencing it fully rendered, with scripts
executing in order to ensure it works properly. With this, you can interact with your
partially-developed world, test world mechanics, and see player controls and
interaction prompts. For more information, see [Preview Mode](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/desktop-editor/getting-started/preview-mode/). You can change modes by selecting the appropriate mode button at the top of the
editor.

 Note: Your cursor isn’t visible while in Preview mode. Instead, the cursor is used to change your avatar’s orientation, as
opposed to the arrow keys or WASD keys, which are used to move in different
directions based on the orientation of your avatar. Click ESC twice to exit Preview mode.
