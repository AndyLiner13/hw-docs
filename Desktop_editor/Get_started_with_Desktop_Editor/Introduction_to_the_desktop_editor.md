# Introduction to the desktop editor

 ImportantUse of the Meta Horizon Worlds desktop editor is limited to persons aged 13 and
above. Meta reserves the right to conduct its own review of the information that
a creator provides to determine whether the age group provided by the creator
is accurate. Any misrepresentation of user's age group may result in rejection,
suspension, or removal of that creator's account and/or world. The desktop editor is one of the main tools you’ll use to create in Meta Horizon
Worlds. It enables you to create nearly all aspects of the worlds in which your
players interact, as well as to create and modify the objects they interact
with. The desktop editor is Windows-based, and you control it with just your
