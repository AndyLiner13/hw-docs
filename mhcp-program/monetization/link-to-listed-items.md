# Link to listed items

Once you have created an item and allowed people to acquire it outside your words, you can amplify its visibility and drive engagement using listing and storefront links. A link is a shareable URL that can be pasted on various platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and other locations to help increase user engagement.

When used well, item listing links and storefront links can maximize the reach and impact of your created items. By strategically integrating them into your promotional efforts across various digital channels, you can significantly boost visibility, enhance user experience, and ultimately drive greater success for your creations.

## Copy an item listing link

Once you’ve created and listed an item, generate links for those items.

To copy a created item’s link, use the following process:

- Open your browser and navigate to the [Developer Dashboard](https://developers.meta.com/horizon/manage/worlds/).
- From the left-side icon menu, select **Digital items**.
- On the inventory page, you will see a list of your created avatar items. You can click the listing link for items you’ve allowed to be listed outside your worlds. You can also click the three dots in the right hand column and select **Copy listing link** from the menu.
- You can also select the item entry and, in the **Listing detail** page, click the **Copy listing link** button to copy the item URL.

You can now paste the copied item URL and it will link directly to the selected item’s product description page in the Meta Horizon mobile app in the avatar editor.

## Copy a storefront link

You can also link directly to your storefront so users can view all of your created items that you’ve allowed to be acquired outside your worlds.

To link to your storefront, use the following process:

- Open your browser and navigate to the [Developer Dashboard](https://developers.meta.com/horizon/manage/worlds/).
- From the left-side icon menu, select **Digital items**.

You can now paste the copied storefront URL and, when clicking it, users will be linked directly to your storefront page in the **Meta Horizon** app in the avatar editor.

**Note**: Users who click on an item or storefront link will be prompted to install the Meta Horizon app if they don’t currently have it installed. Item and storefront links can be shared everywhere, but will only direct users to the link destination when visited on mobile.
