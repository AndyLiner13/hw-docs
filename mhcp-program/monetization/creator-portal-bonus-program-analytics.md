- **Bonus-eligible time spent in VR** - The approximate amount of time visitors spend in your world in headset that can earn a bonus. Eligible time spent is determined by making adjustments to total time spent in a world to remove time spent by creators, collaborators, and playtesters, and to account for any form of suspicious engagement, including unregistered bots or networks of policy-violating user accounts.
- **Bonus-eligible time spent in worlds - Mobile** - The approximate amount of time visitors spend in your world(s) while using a mobile device. Eligible time spent is determined by making adjustments to total time spent in a world to remove time spent by creators, collaborators, and playtesters, and to account for any form of suspicious engagement, including unregistered bots or networks of policy-violating user accounts.

  - **Average Meta Credits exchanged** - The average number of Meta Credits exchanged per eligible monthly unique visitor to a world since the start of the bonus period. This metric is calculated based on all eligible visitors, not just visitors who make an in-world purchase.
  - **Eligible monthly unique visitors** - The number of unique visitors to a world since the start of the bonus period. Creators and collaborators don’t count toward eligible visitors.

## How are visitors calculated?

In order to calculate your visitors for a specific DATE, we actually look at data over a 2 week time-period.

We measure visitors that entered your world between 7 to 13 days before DATE. Any user that visits during this range is counted towards the weekly visitor amount for DATE. For example: if you select April 14, weekly visitors will show the amount of visitors to your world between April 1 - April 7.
