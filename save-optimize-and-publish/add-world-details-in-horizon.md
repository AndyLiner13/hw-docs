# Add world details

As a creator, you can add details to your world to help people discover it. These details include names, descriptions, photos, trailers, and more. In the Developer Dashboard, these details are referred to as *World Metadata*.

## Tips for adding world details

* Use a short, compelling name for your world.
* In the description, briefly let people know what they can do or experience in your world.
* Take a photo that captures specific parts of your world.

## To take a photo of your world:

- While wearing your headset in your world, go to **Preview Mode**.
- Open your **Personal Menu**, then select the Camera icon.
- Grab the selfie stick by holding down either grip.
- Select the reverse arrows to reverse the camera, then use the index trigger to take a photo.

## How to add World Metadata in the Developer Dashboard

- Open your browser and navigate to the [My worlds](https://developers.meta.com/horizon/manage/worlds/) on the Developer Dashboard.
- Select the world you want to add world metadata to.
- From the left-side navigation, select **Distribute** > **World Metadata**.

From here, you can find options for editing both the **Specs & Ratings** and the **Assets** for your world.
