# What is a members-only world?

Members-only worlds deprecated

 Members-only worlds have been deprecated. With the launch of Home Worlds, we recommend using home worlds for private, membership-based experiences. For more information about Home Worlds, please refer to the updated Horizon Worlds documentation.

**Note**: The ability to create members-only worlds is currently only available to a select group of creators as part of an alpha test.

Members-only worlds are a new type of closed space that is membership-based. Creators are responsible for governance in this space and can select members they would like to access their world and set additional world-specific rules. Members-only worlds are a place where communities of like-minded people can come together and enjoy a shared experience. During the alpha test, members-only worlds can have up to 150 members and 25 members can visit the world at the same time; when a world reaches max capacity of 25 members, no additional members can join until someone leaves.
