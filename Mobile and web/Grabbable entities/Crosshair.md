# Crosshair

Picking up a grabbable item on Meta Horizon Worlds for web and mobile displays a crosshair in the center of the screen. By default, this is simply a dot. You can change the crosshair type using the **Crosshair Type** property on grabbable objects.

### Overview
This image depicts a dropdown menu within a user interface, specifically a selection menu for choosing a crosshair type. The menu is part of a larger form or settings panel, indicated by the presence of other form fields and labels around it.

### Key Elements
- **Dropdown Menu**: A black rectangular dropdown menu with rounded corners.
  - **Visual description**: Dark gray background, light gray border.
  - **Location**: Centered horizontally and vertically within the image.
  - **Contents**: Contains four options labeled "None," "Dot," "Cross," and "Spread." The "Dot" option is highlighted with a checkmark next to it.
  - **Visual styling**: White text on a dark background, simple font, no additional styling.
- **Menu Label**: "Crosshair Type" located above the dropdown menu.
  - **Visual description**: Light gray text on a darker gray background.
  - **Location**: Top-left corner of the dropdown menu.
  - **Contents**: "Crosshair Type" text only.
  - **Visual styling**: Simple, sans-serif font, light gray color.
- **Selection Indicator**: A small downward-pointing arrow next to the "Crosshair Type" label.
  - **Visual description**: Light gray, triangular shape pointing downwards.
  - **Location**: To the right of the "Crosshair Type" label.
  - **Contents**: No text, just the arrow indicating the dropdown functionality.
- **Background**: The surrounding area outside the dropdown menu is a dark gray color, likely representing the form's background.
  - **Visual description**: Uniform dark gray color.
  - **Location**: Surrounding the dropdown menu.
  - **Contents**: No text or additional elements.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The dropdown menu is the focal point of the image. The "Dot" option is the most prominent due to its highlighted status. The "Crosshair Type" label and the downward arrow serve as indicators that the dropdown can be expanded. There are no arrows or lines connecting elements, so the visual flow is primarily vertical, following the natural reading order from top to bottom.
