And we'll consider a variety of other subjective areas, like:
• Community involvement. How do you interact in the community? Are you making a positive, substantial contribution by answering questions in the forum or creating educational materials to assist other members?
• Commitment. We value commitment, both over time and in substance.
• Subject-matter expertise. You are an expert and may share that expertise with others.

If you don't currently meet these guidelines, we encourage you to join the [Meta Horizon Creator Program](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/programs), where you can access monetization opportunities, educational programing, technical support, and a community forum to help you level up in Meta Horizon. Get involved in the community and take advantage of all of the tools and resources the program offers so you can build engaging, retentive content that performs well.
