## Description

 The Debug Print CodeBlock in Meta Horizon Worlds is a powerful tool for
understanding and troubleshooting your scripts. It allows you to print messages to the
console from within your scripts, which can help you track your code's execution
and pinpoint where things may not be working as expected. Below is a
comprehensive guide tailored for beginner to intermediate scripters on how to use the Debug
Print CodeBlock effectively and efficiently.  
#### Learning Objectives


• Understand the function and purpose of the Debug Print CodeBlock in a scripting
environment as well as identify where the Debug Print CodeBlock is located
within the script editing tools.
• Understand how the Debug Print CodeBlock can be used to output useful
information to the debug console for debugging purposes.
• Be able to utilize the Debug Print CodeBlock to confirm code paths and values to
track down bugs.

  
## Understanding Debug Print

 The Debug Print CodeBlock outputs a string message to the debug console, which
is accessible in the scripting panel of your build menu. This feature is
invaluable for debugging because it provides insight into the script's behavior in
real-time. ![Image](https://scontent-dfw5-2.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/452914265_512500314621258_7167784275692305544_n.png?_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=e280be&_nc_ohc=vxQDIyO55sYQ7kNvwEm7kjV&_nc_oc=AdmXh9_hbC6-Zp2tV7oNen60GDgdTF21TlAw7bUk0D1yB9zVSJ02OoPlaan5hHJMLs4&_nc_zt=14&_nc_ht=scontent-dfw5-2.xx&_nc_gid=q8Vzp_-jckooCsnW518PEA&oh=00_AfdoH8MTddfLXBxWA...
## Basic Usage
#### Locate the Debug Print CodeBlock

 In your script, find the Debug Print CodeBlock under the "Values" category. It's
specifically listed under "Debugging." ![Image](https://scontent-dfw5-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/452910880_512500331287923_1634991850675751137_n.png?_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=e280be&_nc_ohc=-YBBznrW24cQ7kNvwHvpAXJ&_nc_oc=AdnHpswZfl24kLBj1Wr-BenZ7NLQfDtTEvkw6GGyaR7TcKEUDn65RyH4uZE5YK__-Tk&_nc_zt=14&_nc_ht=scontent-dfw5-1.xx&_nc_gid=q8Vzp_-jckooCsnW518PEA&oh=00_Afc...
#### Insert the Debug Print

 Drag the Debug Print CodeBlock into your script wherever you want to check the
value of a variable, see if a part of the script is executed, or confirm the flow
of logic. ![Image](https://scontent-dfw5-2.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/452702827_512500184621271_9191474485338250662_n.png?_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=e280be&_nc_ohc=-PvNsqtyEekQ7kNvwEspIIa&_nc_oc=AdnxRJQ2LANxRtHD80xDab_cmxRv2cVExSxs5Ov-HUoyyXKUdjIy6gPxDGs-wRTX0c4&_nc_zt=14&_nc_ht=scontent-dfw5-2.xx&_nc_gid=q8Vzp_-jckooCsnW518PEA&oh=00_Afch7CP65AzjipfLN...
#### Customize the Message

 You can type any message within the Debug Print CodeBlock. Often, you'll want to
include variable values in your message for inspection. To do this, you can use
the "variable as string" codeblock (found under "Type Casting") to convert
variables to strings and append them to your debug message. ![Image](https://scontent-dfw5-3.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/452828962_512500311287925_1159263892162828262_n.png?_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=e280be&_nc_ohc=umMs2YMrT4YQ7kNvwGuIudJ&_nc_oc=AdloN-MjXOmrJ52iveRNkGShxTfmnoTwx5mTEEiP2PHy39Ubmb6FyMo3z5v6y6PYvpo&_nc_zt=14&_nc_ht=scontent-dfw5-3.xx&_nc_gid=q8Vzp_-jckooCsnW518PEA&oh=00_Aff...
 Getting started with the Debug Print CodeBlock is a straightforward yet
essential skill for debugging in codeblocks. The following section will guide you
through the fundamental steps of utilizing the Debug Print codeblock, from locating
and inserting it into your script to customizing messages for comprehensive
debugging. Whether you're aiming to inspect variable values, verify script execution, or
clarify the logic flow within your script, the Debug Print CodeBlock provides a
versatile and powerful tool for real-time debugging insights.

## Tips for Effective Debugging


•  Pinpointing Logic Flows: Place Debug Print statements at different points in your script to see which
parts are being executed. This can help you understand the flow of logic and
identify where things might be going awry.
•  Variable Inspection: Frequently print out the values of variables before and after changes. This
can help you catch unexpected values or confirm that your code is modifying
variables as intended.
•  Conditional Debugging: Sometimes, you only want a Debug Print to execute under specific conditions.
Use Debug Print within an "if" statement to only output messages when certain
conditions are met.
•  Iterative Debugging : In loops or iterative processes, use Debug Print to monitor the loop's
progress or to check values at each iteration. Be cautious, as printing in a
high-frequency loop can flood your console.
•  Cleaning Up : Once you've resolved issues, remember to remove or comment out unnecessary
Debug Print codeblocks to keep your script clean and efficient.
## Example Usage

 Imagine you have a script where a variable score is supposed to increment when a
player triggers an event, but it's not working as expected. Here's how you
might use Debug Print to debug this issue: ![Image](https://scontent-dfw5-2.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/452888007_512500181287938_6784621597585849867_n.png?_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=e280be&_nc_ohc=AIo56E4EUccQ7kNvwEoxx-i&_nc_oc=AdnJzcxAhB4LzKWO4Jtu9LAeREs6pPRApmZKAG8MeN5Sgon5OtPux3f9U2oLwZVe3Dc&_nc_zt=14&_nc_ht=scontent-dfw5-2.xx&_nc_gid=q8Vzp_-jckooCsnW518PEA&oh=00_AfcNdbVuf9V...
 This setup allows you to see in the console when the world starts, when the
trigger event occurs, and what the score is after it's supposed to have been
incremented. If you don't see "Trigger entered by player," you know the issue lies with
the trigger detection. If the score doesn't increment as expected, the issue is
with how the score is being updated.  
## Summary

 The Debug Print CodeBlock is a simple yet powerful tool for understanding how
your script behaves in real-time. By strategically placing debug statements
throughout your code, you can gain insights into the execution flow and variable
states, helping you quickly identify and resolve issues. Remember, debugging is an
iterative process, and patience is key. With practice, you'll become more adept at
pinpointing issues and using Debug Print effectively in your Meta Horizon
Worlds projects.
