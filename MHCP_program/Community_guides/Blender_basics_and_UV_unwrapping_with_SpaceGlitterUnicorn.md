## Learning the Blender Interface

 In this section, you will become more familiar with the basic interface, which
includes:
â€¢ 3D Viewport
  â€¢ The 3D viewport in Blender is a 2D rectangle that allows users to visualize and
interact with a 3D object. Itâ€™s the main view that users see when they start
Blender and is used for a variety of purposes, including modeling, animation, and
texture painting.
â€¢ Outliner
  â€¢ The Outliner is the list of items in your blender file, such as mesh items,
lights, materials, etc. This is where you will see your scene collections.
â€¢ Properties Panel
  â€¢ The Properties Panel in Blender is a user interface element that displays and
allows editing of active data, such as the scene and object. The panel has several
categories, or tabs, that group properties and settings by data type.

## Introduction to UV Unwrapping
### Unwrapping the Book Asset: Step-by-Step Guide


1.  UV Editing Mode: Select the book in object mode and locate the UV editing mode at the top center
of the Blender interface. Now that we have the UV tab selected the screens will
split. The left side will be the UV viewport, the right will be the 3D
viewport.
2.  Mark Seam: Start by going into edge select mode and selecting the upper corner seams of
the book, following your way around that very line. After that has been done press
Right Click> Mark Seam, afterward select the inner seam running parallel to the
same set of edge loops, and repeat. Creating seams as if you were cutting a
pattern on a piece of paper.
3.  Project from View: Now that all seams have been marked letâ€™s start unwrapping. Press A to select
all, This ensures the proper parts are selected to work on. Afterward, on the
upper side or the 3D Viewport, Locate the UV drop-down menu and select Project from
View.
4.  Unwrap: On the left-hand side in the UV viewport locate the projected model. Press A to
select all. Afterward, Right Click>Unwrap and you will see the book unwrapped
flat! In 2D form.

 UV Unwrapping Video Walkthrough:         
 Now that weâ€™ve got our models, letâ€™s talk about UV unwrapping. This process
allows us to apply textures to our 3D models. Mentor Note: UV editing in Blender is the process of mapping a 2D image onto a 3D object,
which gives the model more realism and control over how textures appear. The UV
Editor is used to create and edit UV maps, which are flat areas that show how each
face of a 3D object should be textured with a part of the 2D image.
