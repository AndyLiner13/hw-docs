## Types of monetization opportunities

 There are multiple ways to monetize as a Creator:
• In-World Purchases: Create items that can be used in-world. Users can purchase a license to use
these items based on creator specifications. More information on in-world purchases
can be found [here](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/mhcp-program/monetization/meta-horizon-worlds-inworld-purchase-guide).
• Bonus Program: Bonuses reward world contributions to the overall ecosystem across time spent
and in-world purchases. Creators can also earn one-time rewards as they achieve
certain milestones on mobile. More information on the Bonus Program can be found [here](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/mhcp-program/monetization/meta-horizon-worlds-creator-bonus-program).
• Competitions: Enter into competitions throughout the year to win cash prizes.
