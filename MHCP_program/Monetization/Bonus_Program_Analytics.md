## How are visitors calculated?

 In order to calculate your visitors for a specific DATE, we actually look at
data over a 2 week time-period. We measure visitors that entered your world between 7 to 13 days before DATE.
Any user that visits during this range is counted towards the weekly visitor
amount for DATE. For example: if you select April 14, weekly visitors will show the
amount of visitors to your world between April 1 - April 7.
