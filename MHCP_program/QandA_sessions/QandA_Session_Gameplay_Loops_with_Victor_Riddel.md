# Q&A Session: Gameplay Loops with Victor Riddel

              Watch this session for an exclusive intro to Gameplay Loops with Creative
Director and Game Designer Victor Riddel. With an impressive track record of 25+ years in AAA game development and seven
shipped VR titles under his belt, Victor Riddel brings a wealth of knowledge and
expertise to the table.  
## During this session, you’ll learn:


• Key differences between primary, secondary, and tertiary gameplay loops
• How to design gameplay loops that immerse players and keep them coming back for
more
• Strategies for balancing and pacing your loops to create engaging experiences

 Timestamps: [0:09] Intro [24:26] How do you measure the effectiveness of each loop in user testing and
feedback? [27:05] Can I apply gameplay loops to worlds that aren’t games? [29:16] Can you share an example of a 3p world (non meta/2p) that you think
integrates all three loops exceptionally well? [34:26] What external tools, if any, would you recommend for planning and
keeping track of gameplay loops in HW? [35:53] I’m curious how traditional gameplay loops translate into VR with all
the spatial differences? [39:08] Do you feel it’s necessary to have instructions at spawn, or can you
have a world that intuitively can be discovered and learned? [42:44] During the ideation phase, at what step do gameplay loops come in? [45:07] Given the unique nature of how designing is done in Meta Horizon Worlds,
do you find it easier to gray box everything and plan it all first before
designing the entire world, or do you design and brainstorm as you go? What do you
suggest works best for the Meta Horizon Worlds platform? [48:38] Can you share tools and resources to learn more things like this? [50:55] Outro
