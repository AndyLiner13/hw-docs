# MHCP Session: Deep Dive: Meta Horizon Worlds with Andy Sargeant

        Join Andy Sargeant for a comprehensive workshop on adapting your worlds for web
and mobile platforms. This session will cover the fundamentals of setting up or
modifying an existing world and launching it for screen-based experiences. [0:09] Intro [45:06] Is there a way to control the third-person web camera via script to
improve the web experience? [45:39] Can we import a texture for the cross hair? [45:50] Do you have any suggestions to make the world function in “THE STU VOL
2.5” better to make the mobile experience just as enjoyable as VR? [47:07] For the button icons, can creators use their own images? [47:37] When the camera is moved away from the player, is the camera position or
avatar position important for “things?” [49:47] Can we anchor the UI to screen sides/corners? [50:38] Would we need TS if we are just changing triggers to grabbables? [51:20] Is it possible to release for mobile and not desktop or vice versa? [51:42] How do we find the template worlds you showcased? [52:33] Is there a way to only have web/mobile users in a specific world? [53:53] Outro    ![Nav Logo](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/yE/r/3SoBlk8EqOQ.svg)
