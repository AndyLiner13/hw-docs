                                                                                     ### Visual Flow / Relationships
                                                                                     - The heatmap is the most prominent visual element, covering the majority of the image.
                                                                                     - The legend at the bottom provides context for the color coding.
                                                                                     - The interactive controls and data settings panel are secondary elements, providing functionality and configuration options for the heatmap visualization.

                                                                                     <p></p>
                                                                                     
                                                                                     

+ The camera will now persist between refreshes, allowing creators to compare metrics with the same camera angles viewing their data.
+ When filtering data using the Data Settings: Percentile Filter, the heatmap will now recolor the data-cubes based on what is visible. This allows better viewing of high value areas of a world.

* **Creative Guidelines for World Preview Images in Navigator**

+ During the developer keynote at Connect, you may have seen our redesigned UI called Navigator – a personalized hub that makes navigating the metaverse intuitive and seamless.
+ This updated navigation will be coming soon, so to prepare, we’ve updated our [creative guidelines to include world preview images](Save,%20optimize,%20and%20publish/Worlds%20Asset%20Design%20Guidelines.md), which will help attract users and communicate what makes your world unique within Navigator.
+ While adding preview images is optional at this time, we highly recommend adding them soon and at least reviewing these new guidelines to ensure you have high-quality images.

</details>

<p></p>



## New Features

* **NPC Voices update:** When creating an AI NPC in the desktop editor you can now generate a voice for using AI. For more information, check the documentation [here](Desktop%20editor/NPCs/NPC%20Conversation/AI%20Speech%20NPCs.md#voice-and-speech).

## Quality Of Life Improvements

* Noesis Updates.

+ Noesis Gizmo API now exposes two most requested methods:

- `setLocalEntityVisibility(visible: boolean):` Show/hide UI locally for the client
- `changePage(xamlFile: NoesisAssetResource, dataContext?: IUiViewModelObject):` Dynamically switch XAML pages and optionally set a new data context

* **Command Parameter Support:** Developers can now utilize the CommandParameter attribute on XAML UI elements to pass a custom parameter directly to the corresponding TypeScript command handler
* **MouseMove Event Support:** UI elements can now respond to mouse movement using the `MouseMove` event
* **Image Resource Bindings:** Bind image assets to UI Elements in XAML with `{Binding Path=image}` from TypeScript
* **Two-Way Data Binding:** Use `Mode=TwoWay` in XAML for live sync between UI and TypeScript logic
* Support has been added for `GlobalResources.xaml`, which is heavily used by Noesis Studio. This feature enables seamless code sharing across various XAML pages
* **Animation Complete Trigger:** Add triggers for Storyboard completion using the `Storyboard Completed Trigger` and `InvokeCommandAction`

## Bug Fixes

* Fixed the issue with Unity Asset Bundles failing to load textures.
* Fixed an issue where the remote player's avatar is invisible while their player positions and colliders are correct.
* Fixed an issue with the Style2 avatar not refreshing after making changes from the web editor.
* Fixed an issue with being unable to enter the edit mode of a world, resulting in getting kicked out with an error message during loading.
* Fixed an issue with the avatar staying in the sitting pose when trying to move or stand up from a seat on XS platforms.
* Fixed an issue with the matchmaking player limit where only 9 out of 10 players could join worlds, preventing full participation.
* Fixed an issue where Rocky (the AI pet enthusiast NPC from the Pets Park pre-release) had a disembodied voice which could only be heard in certain locations, not attached to his mesh.
* Added the Custom UI Bindings Garbage Collection feature, reducing memory leaks caused by lack of garbage collection for CustomUI bindings.

## New Features

* **Daily Claims Gizmo (MHCP Only):**
  Creators can now boost player engagement by adding the Daily Claims Gizmo to their worlds.

Players simply log in after 1:00 AM UTC and interact with the gizmo to claim their daily reward. Progress is preserved if a day is missed, so players can continue where they left off. The gizmo supports customizable reward sequences, UI themes, and auto-repeat cycles.

## New Features

* **Shop Gizmo Screen Overlay Support (MHCP Only):** The world shop gizmo got an upgrade, it can now be displayed as a screen overlay, instead of the already existing spatial panel, via the new property "Display Mode". When set to "Overlay", but still in edit mode, the only notable change is the appearance of the close button on the panel. Start the simulation and you will see it disappear. To display it, or later hide it, use the new `setShopOverlayVisible` function. Learn more about the shop gizmo  [here](Gizmos/Shop%20gizmo.md).
* **Avatar Item Deep Links (MHCP Only):** Creators can now amplify the visibility of their created avatar items available outside their worlds by sharing direct links to individual listings and storefronts. After listing an item for acquisition outside your worlds, you can generate a shareable URL from the creator portal's item inventory page. These links can be pasted across platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and more, driving engagement and making it easier for users to discover and acquire your creations. Storefront links let users view all your listed items in one place. Learn more about this new feature [here](MHCP%20program/Monetization/Link%20to%20listed%20items.md).
* **Avatar Video Sharing (MHCP Only):** Creators can now share avatar-centric videos directly from Horizon to platforms like Facebook and Instagram, boosting the visibility and engagement of their digital goods. With the new Avatar Video Sharing feature, you can customize your avatar's look, add emotes and backdrops, and showcase avatar goods before sharing. When viewers see your avatar video on IG Stories, they can tap to explore and purchase the digital goods your avatar is wearing, driving discoverability and sales. This integrated experience creates a flywheel effect encouraging more engagement and purchases across the Horizon ecosystem. To get started, ensure you have the Horizon and IG apps installed, access to Video Composer, and your accounts linked. Learn more about this new feature [here](MHCP%20program/Monetization/Avatar%20Posts.md).
* **Public Animation Assets (MHCP Only):** We have released Public Animation Assets, available now for scripting on both Player and Non-Player Characters. This makes available an initial set of animations currently used on player characters including six core emotes, weapon animations and more. Creators can start experimenting with animation scripting without needing to learn how to make new animations themselves. Please check out the new assets in the Public Asset Library to see the full list which can now be found with a new animations asset filter! Learn more [here](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/full-bodied-avatars/creating-avatar-animations).
* **Avatar Creation Prompts (MHCP Only):** Avatars can now be created by AI prompts! This feature was highlighted at Connect and is an expansion of our generative AI tooling suite to help you create new types of fully-rigged avatars from simple prompts. You can learn more about how to create avatars and NPCs on Horizon [here](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/desktop-editor/npcs/npc-gizmo/prompt-to-avatar-npcs).

## Quality Of Life Improvements

* We've improved panel management, making it easier to work with your projects. You can now show or hide the hierarchy and property panels as needed.
* The editor will also remember your last settings when you reopen it, including whether the hierarchy, property, and bottom navigation panels are expanded or collapsed, which tab you had selected, and whether the Gen AI modal was open or closed.

## New Features

* **Remixable Worlds (MHCP Only):** Remix Worlds is a feature that allows creators to make their world(s) cloneable by other creators to build on top of. Available worlds for creators to remix can be found on the Creation Home page of the Horizon editor in the Worlds to Remix section. Creators can make their worlds as remixable in the Publish window within the editor. Learn more about this feature [here](Save,%20optimize,%20and%20publish/Horizon%20Remix%20Worlds.md).
* **Environment Generation Tool (MHCP Only):** The GenAI Environment Generation tool allows you to quickly generate an environment for your world. This tool helps accelerate the process of world and environment building by adding generated meshes of varying sizes and complexities. Currently, this tool supports generating island themed environments, with more themes to come in the future. Learn more about this feature [here](Desktop%20editor/Generative%20AI%20tools/Generative%20AI%20Environment%20Generation%20Tool.md).

## Quality of Life Improvements

* Improved asset spawning to snap to all snappable objects and account for the spawned object's bounding box.
* Improved color tint behavior by making color changes immediately visible to creators.
* Updated AssetPools to spawn versioned assets instead of always spawning latest asset versions to avoid multiple versions of the same asset existing in the scene.

## Bug Fixes

* Fixed bugs related to exporting world geometry and downloading assets file in desktop editor.
* Fixed a bug that prevented NPC avatars from being moved by setting their position directly.

# Meta Horizon v227 Release Notes

This week in v227, we are launching audio previews in the asset library for all creators, which helps find the perfect sound to add to your world. Additionally, more supported audio formats are available including MP3 and FLAC (among others). An exciting community request is now available also as we added two new APIs to make scripting easier with **this.world.findEntity()** and **this.world.findEntities()** which enables creators to reference any entity in code by name.

**Note:** In v226 notes we mentioned an upcoming creator competition. We will have more information on this soon.

    - Audio Previews in Asset Library.
    - Additional Supported Audio Formats.
    - Entity References By Name.
  - **Quality of Life**: One point:
    - Adding new logging so creators are alerted when “no mesh found” errors populate so the error can be detected when developing worlds.
  - **Bug Fixes**: Two points:
    - Fixed a bug where an error message would incorrectly appear when saving and applying a texture that was created with Gen AI.
    - Fixed a bug where any custom UI that was deleted was not properly reverted when using the undo key.

## New Features

* **Audio Previews in Asset Library:** Audio previews in the asset library are now available to all creators. This feature makes finding the perfect sound to add to your world more efficient. To use this feature, click the play button icon on the thumbnail within the asset library for any sound asset.
* **Additional Supported Audio Formats:** We've added support for MP3 (.mp3) and FLAC (.flac) audio file formats, in addition to OGG Opus (.opus) and WAV (.wav). Plus, we've added support for a wider range of sample rates, including 16 kHz, 22.05 kHz, 24 kHz, 44.1 kHz, and 48 kHz. This means you can now upload a wider variety of audio files to your worlds, making it easier to find the perfect sound.
* **Entity References By Name:** Added two new APIs to make scripting easier. **this.world.findEntity()** and **this.world.findEntities()** enables creators to reference any entity in code by name. This is basic functionality creators expect and find in tools like Roblox, Unity and Unreal. Pass in an optional root entity to only search a specific subtree, or a match operation, like starts with, ends with, or even a regex to more specifically query entities. Learn more about this feature [here](Reference/core/Classes/World.md#methods).

## Quality of Life Improvements

* Adding new logging so creators are alerted when "no mesh found" errors populate so the error can be detected when developing worlds.
* "F5" has been improved/updated as a hotkey. By pressing F5, creators will enter play mode, and pressing it again exits play mode, replacing the previous Shift+F5 exit shortcut for a simpler toggle experience.

## Bug Fixes

* Fixed a bug where "Clear on Enter Preview" did not clear the console when entering preview mode.
* Fixed a bug where the bug report hotkey could unintentionally trigger while using the in-game console while in preview mode.
* Fixed a bug where an error message would incorrectly appear when saving and applying a texture that was created with Gen AI.
* Fixed a bug where a black skydome could appear when generating a sky in the Gen AI tab.
* Fixed a bug where any custom UI that was deleted was not properly reverted when using the undo key.

## New Features

* **Social API:** Creators now have the ability to add frictionless social features into their world via TypeScript. A [public demo world](https://horizon.meta.com/world/775581602295298/) has additionally been made for creators to experience the Social API firsthand. Learn more about this new feature [here](Reference/social/Classes/Social.md) and check out some of its abilities below.
  + Show player avatar icons in game
  + Reward players for following each other
  + Reward following new players in the server
  + Reward inviting friends to their server
* **Mobile Gestures API:** We have added a new API module to better help detect and allow creators to improve games that use tap, swipe, pan, and pinch gestures. Learn more about this feature [here](Reference/mobile_gestures/Classes/Gestures.md).
* **World Trailers:** Along with thumbnails, creators are now able to upload trailers to their product description page with future plans to test additional discovery surfaces. Trailers can be uploaded in 16:9 and 9:16 format and give players critical insights and surfacing into your world before jumping in. It is imperative to design for these sizes to put your best foot forward, as landscape videos (16:9) do not look appealing when cropped to another size like 9:16 (and vice versa). Poor cropping can significantly impair clicks and visits.
* **Creator Assistant:**The Worlds Desktop Editor is adding Creator Assistant to its already impressive, integrated, and comprehensive GenAI toolkit. Creator Assistant is your creation partner to not only accelerate the creation process, but make it easier also. Learn more about this feature [here](Desktop%20editor/Generative%20AI%20tools/Generative%20AI%20Assistant%20Tool.md).
* **Style Reference:** Style Reference allows creators to have more consistency and a faster path to desirable output by allowing them to generate, save, and re-use a desired style such that their outputs across modalities can be more consistent with easier prompting. Learn more about this feature [here](Desktop%20editor/Generative%20AI%20tools/Generative%20AI%20Style%20Reference.md).

## Quality of Life Improvements

* Added export support for multiple materials per object, material texture export, multi-UV channels, and specific mesh name.
* Improvements to speed of multiple assets spawning at once.
* All creators are now able to customize particle FX at runtime.

## Bug Fixes

* Fixed a bug where Editor performance degrades significantly when the camera is facing a large number of objects.
* Fixed a bug where the editor could timeout when spawning assets during runtime.
* Fixed a bug where navigating between worlds in the editor could cause NPCs from different worlds to share logs in the NPC Debugger; now, navigating always clears those logs.
* Fixed a bug where creators encountered difficulty transitioning between editor mode and preview mode when operating the door gizmo. Creators will now experience a seamless switch without getting stuck upon exiting preview mode.
* Fixed a bug where it was possible to edit the NPC gizmo's character name and the underlying AI conversation's character name to not match each other, which caused confusion. Now, the NPC gizmo's character name is not editable when an AI is attached, so it will always match the AI name.
* Fixed a bug causing a null reference on spawning Hybrid NPCs client side.

# Meta Horizon v224 Release Notes

In an upcoming release, we will be upgrading the Meta Horizon Desktop Editor to Unity 6. This upgrade ensures you have the most up-to-date and secure experience as a creator. We expect minimal impact to your workflow during this update. To help the update go smoothly, please coordinate with your entire team to update together. We recommend that once your workday is done, everyone shuts down their Desktop Editor. Avoid keeping the Editor open for multiple days in a row, as this can delay the update process.

Additionally this summer, we're testing new Meta Horizon Feed in VR and Meta Horizon mobile app interface designs to improve user engagement and discovery. The new designs will utilize all landscape, portrait and square world preview images. We strongly recommend that you review your existing preview images and ensure you have high-quality images across all three dimensions as soon as possible to ensure that your worlds are eligible to be featured in the upcoming new designs of Worlds discovery surfaces, and [get the best chance of being discovered.](Save,%20optimize,%20and%20publish/Intro%20to%20Worlds%20discovery.md)

To help you create the best preview images to showcase your worlds, we have published new [documentation](Save,%20optimize,%20and%20publish/Worlds%20Asset%20Design%20Guidelines.md) with image guidelines, including templates, examples and best practices. To learn more about the new Horizon Feed and mobile interface designs, please visit the blog [here](https://developers.meta.com/horizon/blog/meta-horizon-design-tests-coming-soon/).
