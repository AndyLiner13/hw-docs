# Feedback tool

With the feedback tool, you can report bugs, submit feedback, and provide suggestions directly to Meta’s product teams, ensuring your input influences product development.

Additionally, the tool provides transparency on how Meta handles your feedback, offering updates as we review, prioritize, and implement your recommendations.

Submit feedback when you:

* Encounter bugs or issues
* Have suggestions for new features and improvements
* Want to leave general feedback about Meta’s tools, SDKs, or services

Your feedback is used to improve the product for everyone. It is not the correct channel to address individual technical concerns, and Meta can’t respond to these. For individual support, use options such as the [Meta Horizon Developer Forums](https://communityforums.atmeta.com/t5/Developer-Forums/ct-p/developer).

All information provided is used in accordance with our [Privacy Policy](https://www.meta.com/legal/privacy-policy/), and includes information such as your user ID, device ID, IP address, location, and any additional information and logs you choose to include.

Feedback submitted via other channels will not necessarily show up on the feedback report.

## Review feedback status

Your feedback and those of other developers are also listed publicly in the [Feedback Center](https://developers.meta.com/horizon/feedback). This is a public voting board where you can view summarized cases of the bugs and feature requests sent to Meta.

![Feedback Center landing page](https://scontent-dfw5-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/553024575_820695697135050_2462457569513942397_n.png?_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=e280be&_nc_ohc=h8RbhK8lKJoQ7kNvwGRJseY&_nc_oc=AdmaN9Ku2o-WfOU4XVay1GtKSyhgJqe8b3BNSgo17hNqKZeZdCf0OFpI0xg4CwIJPxY&_nc_zt=14&_nc_ht=scontent-dfw5-1.xx&_nc_gid=4ebpZy2-jp8pYknoBKFrGA&oh=00_AfhCdZ09rZKKPtdMxF0dnKvlk68AgQ0xG9UdcIHeTKxC7w&oe=692BE443)

Feedback reports you submit are listed in the Feedback Center along with their status such as “Received”, “Investigating”, and so on. When logged into Developer Center, you can upvote items on the public voting board to increase their priority. The public voting board aims to increase transparency, improve creator engagement, and inform product priorities. It provides a clear view of how feedback is handled. Meta teams review the investigations and keep the case information accurate and up to date.
