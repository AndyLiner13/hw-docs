# Install the desktop editor

Build immersive worlds and experiences on Meta Horizon Worlds with our desktop editor, a free, Windows-based application.

The desktop editor gives you access to powerful tools that accelerate your creation of fun and engaging worlds. You can then publish your worlds across mobile, mixed reality, and desktop to reach a broader audience.

## Prerequisites

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Meta account** | A Meta Horizon Worlds account is required.  If you don’t have one, see the [Meta Horizons Worlds](https://horizon.meta.com/) page for more information. |
| **Hardware** | Windows 10 and up, Intel i5-4590 and up, 8 GB+ RAM.  [Learn about required specs](https://www.meta.com/help/quest/articles/headsets-and-accessories/oculus-link/requirements-quest-link/). |
| **Rules & Terms** | Age 13 and up. Meta reserves the right to conduct its own review of the information that a creator provides to determine whether the age group provided by the creator is accurate. Any misrepresentation of the user’s age group may result in rejection, suspension, or removal of that creator’s account and/or world. For more information, see our [Supplemental Terms of Service](https://www.meta.com/legal/supplemental-terms-of-service/) and [Privacy Policy](https://www.meta.com/legal/privacy-policy/). |
| **Custom TypeScript** | [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) is the default IDE for the editor, but see [Adding an IDE to Desktop Editor](/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/typescript/getting-started/adding-an-ide-to-desktop-editor) to add another third-party IDE instead. This is optional but is highly recommended for an optimal experience within the editor. **Note**: VSCode or another IDE needs to be installed separately from the desktop editor. |
