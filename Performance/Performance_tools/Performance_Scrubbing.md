...
## Use case

 You’re testing a new weapon in your world, so you have the real time metrics
panel open. When you fire the weapon, you notice that your frame time graph spikes,
revealing a slow down in your world’s performance. To find out why this may
have happened, you click “inspect” and open the scrubbing panel. You look for the
spike in frame time, adjusting the scrubber to highlight the frame where it
occurred. You scroll through other metrics, noticing that there is a spike in the
scripting metric. Scrubbing has given you a clue that you should check the scripts
for the new weapon and work on their performance to fix the spike.

# Performance Scrubbing

 Horizon’s scrubbing feature enables you to analyze performance events in your
world. This testing procedure will help you identify events that are causing
slowdowns and will provide important clues on what to do. Scrubbing can help you
solve performance problems by making it possible to selectively step through and
analyze graphical data displayed in the Performance Metrics panel. This data
includes metrics for frame time (FPS), GPU time, scripting, physics workload, other
users building in Horizon, and more. These graphs are compiled from the last
several thousand frames, about 30 seconds while playing at target FPS. Scrubbing adds
the ability to inspect the graphs and test the data in the following ways:
• Select a range of frames from the total recorded.
• Move and resize the selected range.
• For all metrics, select an individual frame to see the value at that frame.
• Determine which metrics are above their target value, including when that
happened.
...

# Performance Scrubbing
...
• Expand metrics to see metadata, such as the average, minimum, maximum, and
target values.

 This scrubbing procedure can be done from within Virtual Reality (VR). You don’t
have to take off your VR headset, and you don’t have to use passthrough. This
will allow you to analyze and test performance and regressions easier and more
efficiently.
