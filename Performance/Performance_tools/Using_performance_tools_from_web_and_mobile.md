 With Scrubbing, you can review data that has recently appeared on the
Performance panel (approximately 30 seconds of data) in detail. Click the Inspect button to open the Scrubbing view. Click and drag the blue box at the top of the panel to the data you would like
to review. This box represents a range, measured in frames. You can resize the
box by clicking and dragging the handles on the sides of the box. Below the Frame Time scrubber, a “zoomed-in,” detailed view is shown for each
metric, spanning the frames covered by the blue box. By changing the range, you
can choose whether to focus on a short span of time, or a broader view over a
longer period. ![The world with the detailed view of the Frame Time scrubber opened and a span

## Tracing

 With Tracing, you can capture performance data from your world to [view in Perfetto](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/performance-best-practices-and-tooling/performance-tools/analyzing-trace-data-with-perfetto). You can choose between three trace types:
•  Overview - An overview trace can help set a baseline for how your world is performing in
visit mode. It captures high-level data like FPS, CPU, and GPU. Additionally,
overview provides a high-level capture of metrics like physics, rendering, and
lighting to identify possible sources of performance impact and provide a
direction for deeper investigation.
•  Deep - A deep trace provides scripting information and metrics like draw calls. It’s
best used for identifying specific performance improvements like optimizing
physics, colliders, and tri/poly count of certain meshes as well as reducing draw
calls in a particular area. Deep traces are the most commonly run because they

can give more specific, actionable information when it comes to performance
optimizations.
•  Playtest - Playtest capture allows for up to 2 hours of gameplay to be recorded across
multiple worlds without needing to be plugged in or running any special software.
This type of trace can be taken on any build, anytime, anywhere. Playtest
capture generates a report similar to the ones we use internally to track the
performance of our hottest worlds and the performance of Horizon itself. Unlike other
types of traces, which are viewable in Perfetto, the results of this trace are
viewable on the [Horizon website](https://horizon.meta.com/creator/performance/reports). In general, playtest traces are best used for initial testing.
