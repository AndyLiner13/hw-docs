# Traffic Attribution Analytics

Traffic attribution analytics offers creators a clear view into how users are discovering and entering their world in Meta Horizon Worlds. The dashboard surfaces data on the sources and entry points that drive visits—such as device type, Meta product surfaces, and referrals from other worlds—enabling creators to see which channels are most effective at bringing in new and returning visitors. By understanding these traffic patterns, creators can optimize their promotional strategies, enhance user acquisition efforts, and make data-driven decisions to maximize the reach and impact of their worlds.

- Select Insights to open the analytics dashboard.
- Select Traffic Attribution from the available options.
- Use the filters to select period, and date ranges.
- Review the charts and tables to understand your world’s audience.
- Export data as CSV for further analysis if needed.
