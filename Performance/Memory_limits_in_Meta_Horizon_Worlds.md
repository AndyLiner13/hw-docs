# Memory limits in Meta Horizon Worlds

## Memory best practices

 When creating your Worlds, there are many strategies and best practices to keep
memory costs low. Even if your World does not exceed the memory limit, reducing
your World's memory usage can provide additional benefits, such as reduced load
times. We have compiled a set of best practices to help you get started reducing your
memory usage here: [Memory Best Practices](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/performance-best-practices-and-tooling/performance-best-practices/memory-best-practices/).  

## Real-time performance metrics

 Access to real-time metrics can help you identify and address aspects of your
World that are consuming the most resources, including memory. For full details on
the real-time metrics panel, see [Enabling and Modifying the Real-time Metrics Panel](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/performance-best-practices-and-tooling/performance-tools/enabling-and-modifying-the-realtime-metrics-panel/). To enable real-time metrics in Meta Horizon Worlds:
1. Visit a world in any mode.
2. Turn either of your wrists towards you to activate the wearable.
3. Open the PUI and open Settings.
4.  Click on the Utilities tab and enable the utilities menu.![Image](https://scontent-dfw5-1.oculuscdn.com/v/t64.5771-25/39036683_537601795737638_1061973206288611017_n.png?_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=e280be&_nc_ohc=cLGo-wA8bKwQ7kNvwEmIBIx&_nc_oc=AdlXTa62Pl9VBWPPvEkwr4xRJqAKxpxYWtjnCl3IYsGhTJDQAW2myKhRapMJmk_iUvU&_nc_zt=3&_nc_ht=scontent-dfw5-1.oculuscdn.com&oh=00_Aff8Fgqo268ItgEOtM_0IKY8o663OaXEhj9chu...
5.  Once the wearable is open, tap the Real-time metrics button under Utilities to open the Real-time metrics panel.![Image](https://scontent-dfw5-2.oculuscdn.com/v/t64.5771-25/75282161_485350857190282_7080255518188907201_n.png?_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=e280be&_nc_ohc=bRA5f0pMCZQQ7kNvwGWoF3i&_nc_oc=Adn1Ktmfog2aFTjRlD-3Iiaom7ELO_IOdipkK-FOJVlvY2A8HLkSD7BUh99kPAVqq-A&_nc_zt=3&_nc_ht=scontent-dfw5-2.oculuscdn.com&oh=00_AfcrC7n3DCVwOYCHR...

# Memory limits in Meta Horizon Worlds

 On July 12, 2024, Meta Horizon Worlds will begin enforcing a 6 GB memory limit
in Edit Mode on Quest 2 and Quest 3 devices. Worlds that exceed this limit run
the risk of causing the device to close the Meta Horizon Worlds app. In order to help meet this limit, creators will be restricted from publishing or
adding assets to Worlds that are over 6 GB. In order to help creators better
understand resource usage in their Worlds, we have added a memory metric to our
real-time performance monitoring tool and are releasing the tool to all creators.
