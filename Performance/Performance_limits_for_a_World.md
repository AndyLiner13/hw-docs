# Performance limits for a World

## Runtime world budgets

 Understanding runtime limits enables you to effectively allocate the total
number of assets required for creating your world, and develop a comprehensive asset
plan. These limits are view dependent however, since there is no occlusion
culling, the world limit can often approach the following view limits.
|  |
|  |
| Total Vertices | 600,000 | 1 Million |
| Draw Calls | 200 | 550 |

  

## Travel time world budgets

 The following limits are designed to keep world travel times in check,
especially for visitors with lower internet speeds.
|  |
|  |
| Unique Vertices | 200k | 400k |
| Texture Megapixels | 40 megapixels | 80 megapixels |

 One megapixel is equivalent to an area of 1024 x 1024 bits. Therefore, a 2048 x
2048 bit area is four megapixels. More megapixels means it takes more time to
load the textures, which may impact world travel times or take the world longer to
look fully loaded. 40 Megapixels = 25 MB (ASTC 6x6).  

## Generic asset recommendation

 We recommend the following general limits.
|  |
|  |
| 5 m3Object | 2000 | 1000 | 2048 x 2048 |
| 1 m3Object | 1000 | 500 | 512 x 512 |

  

## Miscellaneous recommendations

 We also recommend the following limits.

# Performance limits for a World

 All systems have limits. When designing a world, you should consider the
following world limits. Keep in mind that these are ballpark numbers and may not apply
to every world under every condition. We recommend using the performance tools
to validate and ensure you're considering the conditions for your own world when
creating in Meta Horizon Worlds.
