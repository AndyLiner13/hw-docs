# 3D Modeling Tool Resources

This article provides links to introductory resources that will help you learn more about Blender and other 3D modeling tools.

## Blender

Blender is a popular free open source software program for building 3D models. It is a public project hosted on blender.org, licensed as GNU GPL and owned by its contributors. It can be downloaded directly from the [Blender Website.](https://www.blender.org/)
