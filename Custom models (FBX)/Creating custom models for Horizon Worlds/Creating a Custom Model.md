# Creating a Custom Model

This document explains how to create custom models that will provide highly detailed 3D objects you can use to build rich visual assets and experiences in Horizon. These assets consist of shapes, textures, and materials that simulate real world objects or scenes.

The Quickstart video tutorial below will show you how to make a simple dice asset using Blender to define its mesh shapes, and Adobe Substance Painter to add textures and materials. The following section describes how to upload your finished model.

## Setup Requirements

Before you can begin using Custom Models in Horizon, you will need specific assets and software.

* DCC tools such as Maya, Blender, or Adobe

## Quickstart Video Tutorial

This video demonstrates how easy it is to bring in an object from Blender and add textures and materials with Adobe Substance Painter to create a custom model for uploading into your Horizon World.

## 3D Modeling 101

This series of videos, provided by the Meta Horizon Creator Program (MHCP), is a comprehensive introduction to 3D modeling using Blender.

## Uploading Finished Models

> **Note:** This only works for unanimated rigid models; skeletal deformations are not supported with this upload flow.

When you have completed your custom 3D model, it is ready to be uploaded.

### Uploading Procedure

Follow these steps to upload your custom model into your Horizon World.

- Make sure you are signed into your Meta account, then navigate to [https://horizon.meta.com/](https://horizon.meta.com/creator/assets/).
- Select the folder you wish to upload into and select **import**.

  ### Overview
  This image depicts a dialog box titled "Asset Import" which is part of a user interface for importing asset files into a system. The dialog box includes instructions, file selection options, and a preview area.
  
  ### Key Elements
  - **Title**: "Asset Import" located at the top-left corner.
  - **Instruction Box**: A light gray box containing a light bulb icon and text explaining the import process.
  - **Drag-and-Drop Area**: A dashed rectangle in the center with a folder icon, a play button icon, and a document icon. Below this area, there is text indicating "Drag and drop to upload Or choose files on your device."
  - **File Selection**: Two files are highlighted within a red circle: "DiceMaterial_BR.png" and "HorizonDice.fbx". These files are listed under the drag-and-drop area.
  - **Button**: A blue rectangular button labeled "Import" located at the bottom-right corner.
  - **Cancel Button**: A gray rectangular button labeled "Cancel" located next to the "Import" button.
  
  ### Visual Flow / Relationships
  The most prominent visual element is the "Drag and Drop Area" as it occupies the central space and guides the user on how to interact with the interface. The files are listed below the drag-and-drop area, and the "Import" and "Cancel" buttons are positioned at the bottom-right corner, suggesting that these actions should be performed after selecting the desired files.
