# Five Flavors of Sticky Core Loops

In the article, ***[Building Content to Optimize User Time](https://developers.meta.com/horizon/blog/optimize-user-time-goldilocks-session-length-meta-quest)*,** we explored the “Goldilocks zone” for optimal play sessions — 20 to 40 minutes for VR, and typically shorter for mobile. Core loops (also called quests) should fit within these windows to maximize engagement without overstaying their welcome. But hitting the right session length is only part of the formula. To design experiences that keep players coming back, Meta Horizon creators also need to tap into the motivations that drive engagement in the first place.

In this article, we’ll break down five core loop motivators that can help you attract and retain players: **Customization, Collection, Care, Competition, and Narrative**. By weaving one or more of these into your world, you can design loops that capture attention early and stay compelling well beyond a player’s first session.

## What is a core loop?

A core loop refers to the repetitive sequence of gameplay mechanics and activities that players engage with throughout the game. For example, in *Super Mario Bros.*, the core loop is simple: move and jump to clear obstacles and finish levels.

Core loops matter because they provide clear goals and feedback, taking the guesswork out of finding fun. They also form the backbone of the ‘earned economy,’ making them the central, most engaging part of play that keeps players coming back.

A core loop usually consists of **three key elements**:

- **Motivation**: A clear goal or objective that drives player action.
  *Example: Reach the end of the level while collecting coins.*
- **Action**: The mechanics or activities performed to achieve the goal
  *Example: Run and jump to clear obstacles while tracking progress.*
- **Reward**: The satisfaction or benefits players receive for completing the action. Rewards reinforce ownership and commitment.
  *Example: Level up or unlock a new character.*

## Five drivers that motivate play within and across sessions

A well-designed core loop is engaging, challenging, and rewarding — making it the main engine of retention. Our research highlights five motivators that can be built into a loop, individually or together, to deepen engagement and keep players returning to your World.

## Customization

**Customization** turns play into self-expression. Players use it to showcase identity or explore fantasy.

| **Driver Element** | **Player Experience** |
| --- | --- |
| **Why it works** | Gives players agency and individuality. |
| **Key components** | A wide range of choices plus visibility into what others are creating. |
| **Retention factors** | Ability to save and level up creations, showcase them socially, and benefit from ongoing updates or seasonal refreshes. |
| **Example** | In **[Yeet Yourself,](https://horizon.meta.com/world/10162537277428570/?locale=en_US)** earnable items and visible style choices not only motivate players but also spark conversation in the lobby. |

## Collection

**Collection** drives engagement through discovery and value. Players gather items to curate, display, or use in play.

| **Driver Element** | **Player Experience** |
| --- | --- |
| **Why it works** | Collecting taps into scarcity, surprise, and the satisfaction of completing sets. |
| **Key components** | Unlockable or discoverable items, gacha-style draws, limited or seasonal content, and storefronts. |
| **Retention factors** | Opportunities to showcase, trade, or gift collections; fresh items released regularly to set new goals. |
| **Example** | In **[BattleKin](https://horizon.meta.com/world/626371176927879/?locale=en_US)**, the ability to collect and test different creatures deepens play and progression. |

## Care

**Care** builds bonds between players, pets, NPCs, or communities through nurturing and reciprocity.

| **Driver Element** | **Player Experience** |
| --- | --- |
| **Why it works** | Care-based gameplay fosters strong player bonds by allowing them to build relationships with in-game entities such as pets or NPCs. |
| **Key components** | Simple ways to show support — gifting, collaborating, sharing advice — and easy access to entities worth caring for. |
| **Retention factors** | Visible payoffs over time, such as pets leveling up or friendships strengthening. |
| **Example** | **[Sky Pets](https://horizon.meta.com/world/10163055433003944/?locale=en_US)\_** visibly respond to kindness, while **[Fire & Rescue](https://horizon.meta.com/world/10102941330447362/?locale=en_US)** and **[We’ll Only Make It Together](https://horizon.meta.com/world/10112203795517760/?locale=en_US)** reward teamwork with stronger performance. |

## Competition

**Competition** structures play around skill, rankings, and outcomes.

| **Driver Element** | **Player Experience** |
| --- | --- |
| **Why it works** | Competition adds excitement and supports a sense of accomplishment. |
| **Key components** | Challenges that require skill with clear outcomes, the ability to win or lose in short (3-5 minute) sessions, and easy ways to see and share success. |
| **Retention factors** | Options to practice and see payoffs, track progress over time, and engage with fresh challenges. |
| **Example** | In **[Thieves & Warlocks,](https://horizon.meta.com/world/10110937922692050/?locale=en_US)** players race across lava and defend their gold. Leaderboards and tied purchase options extend success across sessions, while solo challenges ensure competition stays engaging even without groups. |

## Narrative

**Narrative** uses play to reveal or co-create storylines.

| **Driver Element** | **Player Experience** |
| --- | --- |
| **Why it works** | Stories add depth and make players eager to see what happens next. |
| **Key components** | Unlockable chapters, ties to lore or popular IP, and opportunities for players to extend stories they love. |
| **Retention factors** | Roleplay and character connections, progressing arcs over time, and space for co-creation across sessions. |
| **Example** | In **[Cometfall](https://horizon.meta.com/world/10160524752977364/?locale=en_US)**, ongoing storylines sustain engagement, while **[Profit or Perish](https://horizon.meta.com/world/1416619966401136/?locale=en_US)** adds humor and twists through boss encounters. |

While each of these core loop drivers can be engaging on their own, they also help break the ice and add depth to social play.
