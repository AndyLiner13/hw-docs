- Adjust your camera sensitivity.

Drag the slider to change how fast you want the camera to move when you’re navigating with WASD or a controller. A lower sensitivity means slower camera movement while a higher sensitivity means faster camera movement.

## Share your recorded video

Once you’ve recorded your footage, export your video and share it on Reels, Instagram, TikTok, or anywhere you want to showcase your world. Promo videos are a powerful way to attract new visitors, promote events, and build your community.

## Settings and how they work

There are many settings to help you record your world. Here’s a breakdown of how each setting works.

| **Toggle** | **What it does** |
| --- | --- |
| Camera mode | Choose the POV of your camera.  *Single Camera*: Full-screen, controllable camera. See controls for single camera [below](Record%20world%20videos.md#controls-for-single-camera-mode).  *Player POV*: Records from the player’s perspective (the way it looks during gameplay). The camera will follow behind the player. |
| Aspect ratio | If you want your video to look great on phones and social media, choose 9:16 (portrait). This vertical format is the standard for mobile screens. For desktop or standard YouTube videos, use 16:9 (landscape). |
| Only record global audio | When on, anyone speaking *anywhere* in the world will be captured. Your recording will ignore audio zones you may have set for your world. |
| Disable name tags | Hides all player name tags in your recording, making the video look cleaner and more private. |
| Hide your avatar | Make your avatar invisible in the recording, so you don’t accidentally appear in your own video. |
| Hide UI elements | Removes all on-screen menus and buttons from your recording, so the video only shows the world itself. |
| Mute yourself | Turns off your microphone for the recording, so your own voice or background noise isn’t captured. |
| Camera speed | Adjusts how fast the camera moves when you use the controls. Set this lower if you want smother, slower camera movement. |
| Recording | Start the recording process after configuring other options. |
