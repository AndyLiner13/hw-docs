# Worlds Taxonomy Guidelines

To ensure your world is relevant in the Meta Horizon Store, it’s essential to have relevant world types and genres in your world’s metadata.

* **World Type (Mandatory):** This refers to the primary type that best defines your world. It represents the main objective or activity within a Horizon World.
* **Primary Genre (Mandatory)**: This is the main genre that best describes your world. It should be the genre that users would most likely associate with the world at first glance.

The first type or genre will be considered primary. To add additional context to the world, you may add up to two additional types or genres, for a maximum total of three.

The world type, genres and their associated attributes are as follows:

## World type: Available types

You will need to apply one mandatory primary type, an optional secondary type and an optional tertiary type, as appropriate.

Select from the following:

### Game world

Worlds designed primarily for interactive gameplay, where players engage in structured activities, challenges, or competitions. These worlds often feature objectives, rules, and mechanics that create a game-like experience, encouraging players to achieve specific goals or high scores.

* Examples: [Super Rumble](https://horizon.meta.com/world/10230277629074528/), [Action Island](https://horizon.meta.com/world/3713380242015344/), [Farm Tycoon](https://horizon.meta.com/world/910389744073698/)

If your world is a game world, you might want to add additional details (optional) that would describe it best:

* **Game Theme:** The overarching setting, motif, or narrative context of a game, which provides the backdrop and atmosphere of the game, influencing its story, characters, and visual style. There are 18 Game Themes, such as “Animals”, “Fantasy”, “Historical”, “Horror” and others. Themes in games are not mutually exclusive, meaning multiple themes can be applied to a single game. However, the themes selected should be integral to the game’s overall experience. For instance, themes such as “Aliens,” “Animals,” or “Monsters” suggest that these elements are not merely present but play a significant role as characters that shape the game’s setting, motif, or narrative. When applying themes, ensure they are pivotal to the game’s identity and contribute meaningfully to its storytelling and atmosphere.
