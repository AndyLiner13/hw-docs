# Adding Core Loops for Retention

Our mission is to **incentivize users to find the best content in the metaverse and discover deeply engaging experiences that improve the quality of time spent in Horizon.** We want people to feel good about the time they invest and that the things they get from their time investment will make their next sessions more fun and enjoyable. In this article, we will review how leveraging a core loop in your game can help retain and engage users. We will review: the basics of a core loop, why they work, and how they have engaged players in Horizon Worlds.

## What is a core loop?

A core loop refers to the repetitive sequence of gameplay mechanics and activities that players engage with repeatedly throughout the game that form the backbone of the “earned economy”. It’s typically the central, most engaging and rewarding part of the game that keeps players coming back for more.

A core loop typically consists of three key elements:

- **Motivation**: A clear goal or objective that drives the player’s actions.
- **Action**: The gameplay mechanics and activities that the player performs to achieve the goal.
- **Reward**: The satisfaction, progress, or benefits that the player receives as a result of completing the action. Users feel a sense of commitment and ownership when they have invested time and effort into gaining items.

The core loop is designed to be engaging, challenging, and rewarding, making it the primary driver of player retention and enjoyment. It is often used in games with high replay value, such as multiplayer online battle arenas (MOBAs), massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs), and mobile games with daily challenges.

Example of a Core Loop:

* **Motivation**: Collect 10 coins to unlock a new character skin.
* **Action**: Play through levels, complete challenges, or defeat enemies to collect coins.
* **Reward**: Unlock the new character skin, which provides a sense of accomplishment and visual customization.

## Why do core loops work? – UX Research insights

Core loops drive players to engage with games and apps repeatedly and earn rewards for their efforts. An “earned economy ecosystem” drives platform-level economy in two ways:

- Having a path to earn digital goods across the metaverse is key for **driving value** in digital goods by adding dimensions of time and effort into perceived value.
- Platform core loop systems provide an opportunity for creators to have a **lever for engagement** and traffic into their experiences.

Core loops engage users for several psychological and design-related reasons. By incorporating these elements, core loops can create a highly engaging experience that consistently give players content to enjoy.

- **Variable Rewards**- Core loops often incorporate variable rewards which activate the brain’s reward system. Players will be eager to continue playing in anticipation of the next reward.
- **Progression and Accomplishment**- Core loops provide a sense of progression and accomplishment as players complete tasks, collect rewards, or level up. Players are motivated to continue striving for more achievements, as challenges continue to increase in difficulty.
- **Clear Goals and Feedback**- Core loops typically have clear goals and provide immediate feedback on progress. This clarity helps players understand what they need to do to succeed, giving them a sense of control and agency.
- **Repetition**- The repetitive nature of core loops makes it easier for players to engage with the game regularly. As players repeat the loop, their brains create a mental shortcut, allowing them to perform the actions without much conscious thought.
- **Emotional Investment**- Core loops can create an emotional investment in the game by providing a sense of ownership and customization. Players become attached to their characters, items, or progress, making them more likely to enjoy playing.
- **Social Interaction and Community**- Many core loops involve social interaction, such as multiplayer modes or leaderboards. This social aspect fosters a sense of community, encouraging players to compete, cooperate, or share experiences with others.

## Core Loops Work – What We Know From Player Data

In this article, we’ve already discussed that core loops refer to the repetitive sequence of gameplay mechanics and activities that drive player engagement. Below we discuss how core loops have already proven successful in the Horizon Worlds ecosystem by following three best practices:

- **Leverage Core Loop systems to amplify engagement:** Drive users to interact with your most compelling content using Core Loop mechanics.
- **Compelling rewards are key:** Offer attractive and meaningful rewards with more appealing rewards yield greater impact.
- **Keep rewards fresh and rotating:** Regularly refresh reward content to maintain effectiveness, as stale rewards lead to diminishing returns over time.

### **Leverage Core Loop systems to amplify engagement**

An effective core loop quest with compelling rewards significantly engages users. When Giant Paddle Mini Golf introduced reward content, they observed substantial increases in incentivized user actions. For instance, creating a quest that encouraged users to achieve Par at least once led to an increase in the percentage of users achieving Par. More importantly, users who received a reward experienced an even greater increase in their rate of achieving Par.

### **Compelling rewards are key**

As previously noted, users who were offered rewards showed increased engagement with core loop quest content. This was further reinforced by a recent season event featuring weekly new quests and a set of rewards that could be earned throughout the season. Notably, every time a new reward was released, Paddle Mini Golf observed significant spikes in engagement. In contrast, the launch of new quests did not trigger similar spikes in engagement. This suggests that the promise of rewards is a key driver of user behavior, supporting the hypothesis that rewards are the primary motivator for core loop engagement (see graphic below).

### **Keep rewards fresh and rotating**

Rewards do not maintain their impact forever, as users will eventually acquire the rewards you offer. To maintain engagement, it’s crucial to establish a consistent flywheel of fresh rewards. A recent case study illustrates this point: when a world on Horizon Worlds introduced a new gun skin, in-world purchases surged. However, within a month, this lift returned to baseline as the content became stale. This highlights the importance of regularly refreshing rewards to sustain user interest and drive continued engagement.
