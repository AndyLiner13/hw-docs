# Developer Dashboard features

The [Developer Dashboard](https://developers.meta.com/horizon/manage/worlds) is your central hub for managing all management and administrative aspects of your worlds. This platform empowers app developers and worlds creators to oversee their creations from development through distribution, providing tools to manage worlds, configure in-world items, set up player variables, and access platform services.

The Developer Dashboard features an intuitive left-side icon menu that organizes all functionality into distinct sections:

* **Worlds** - Create, build, manage your world projects, and access world insights
* **Digital items** - Configure in-world items and avatar accessories
* **Assets** - Manage media assets and resources for your worlds
* **Creator Program** - Access monetization opportunities and creator benefits
* **Events** - Host and manage community events within your worlds
* **Team** - Collaborate with team members and manage permissions
* **Account** - Configure personal settings, notifications, and verification

## Worlds

The **Worlds** page serves as your primary landing page as a world creator in the Developer Dashboard. Accessible through the left-side navigation menu, this comprehensive section organizes world management into three key areas:

* **Development** - Build and configure your world’s core functionality
* **Distribution** - Manage versions, release channels, and publishing workflow
* **Engagement** - Set up features that drive user retention and interaction
* **[Insights](../Performance/Analytics/World%20Analytics.md)** - View analytics to track your world’s performance

### World overview and management

The main Worlds page provides a centralized view of all your world projects. You can filter worlds by name and view projects created by your team, with the ability to access worlds from any team through the Developer Dashboard’s [Worlds](https://developers.meta.com/horizon/manage/worlds) page.

For each world, you’ll see essential information at a glance including the preview image, world name, app submission status, release status, and current player count.

### World detail pages

Each world has its own dedicated detail page where you can:

* **Monitor build status** - View production build status and assigned world categories, which correspond to top-level navigation in the Meta Horizon Store
* **Continue submissions** - Resume the submission process for worlds in draft status (for complete publishing guidance, see [Publishing](Publish%20your%20world.md))
