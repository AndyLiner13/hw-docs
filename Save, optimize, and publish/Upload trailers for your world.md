# Upload trailers for your world

Though optional, trailers are the first impression of your world. High-quality, engaging trailers help attract users and communicate what makes your world unique. You can create trailers using any existing tools and add them to your world. This document outlines best practices and requirements for uploading your trailers to showcase your world effectively across discovery surfaces.

## World trailer upload specifications

Note the following upload specficiations specifications for trailers.

* Length: 30 seconds and 2 minutes in length
* Aspect ratio: 16:9 or 1:1 aspect ratios
* Resolution: 1080p (min) 2k (max) resolution
* Format: MP4/H.264/AAC

Once uploaded, we may apply transformations such as transcoding and compression to the uploaded trailers, which can change the specifications of the video as served to users.

## Where trailers are visible

Currently, only the landscape trailer will be displayed on the Mobile Horizon App world details page. With an approved landscape trailer, the preview image will be replaced by the trailer on the Horizon App world details page.

In the future, trailers of your worlds will appear on various discovery surfaces across mobile and VR, such as Feed, Search, and Store. Generally, most locations currently showing a world preview image can be updated to display a trailer with the same aspect ratio. New dedicated spaces on both mobile and VR like the World Reels feeds will also show your trailers in the future.

In addition, your trailers might be used in Quick Promotion units across Meta’s Family of Apps—including Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger, and Threads—which display promotional or informational content prominently to effectively engage users.

As the ecosystem grows, your trailers can be used in many more places. Please try to keep the content of trailers of different aspect ratios aligned to offer a consistent experience and visual style across all locations.

## Uploading your trailers

You can upload your trailers using the Developer Dashboard and the following steps:

- Open your browser and navigate to the [Developer Dashboard](https://developers.meta.com/horizon/manage/worlds).
- Choose your world.
- Click **Edit world details**.
- On the **World details** page, click **Assets**.
- Scroll down to the bottom of the **Assets** page.
- Upload your trailer.

### Troubleshooting uploads

If there are any issues with the format of your trailer, you’ll get a error message. Address the error, and try to upload the trailer again. For additional assistance, see [Support](https://developers.meta.com/horizon/support).

### Check your trailer processing status

Once you upload your trailer successfully, the system will process your selected video. Note that it takes some time for an uploaded video to be processed. You can check the review status by viewing the info on the world card or opening the upload tool to see the status label next to the trailer title. Video processing occurs asynchronously and takes time.

While processing your video upload will be in one of the following states:

* **Processing**: The system is processing the video. Check back later for the updated status.
* **Processing Failed**: Video processing failed due to content or format issues. You can’t preview the video right now. Click the upload box to select a new video to replace the failed one.
* **Approved**: Video processing has finished successfully. It will be visible to users once the world is published.
* **Live**: Your world is published and the trailer is visible to users.
* **Approved Draft**: Video processing has finished successfully, but the trailer experience for this aspect ratio is not yet available. It will be served once the experience is open to users.

Please note that you can delete or replace the video as long as it is not in processing status. Any replaced video will restart the processing like the initial upload.

**Important:** A content integrity review process starts once the video processing finishes. Contents that violate [World content guidelines](/hw-mcp-tools/documentation/hw-docs/Save,%20optimize,%20and%20publish/Worlds%20content%20guidelines.md) can be unpublished or soft deleted automatically.

## Best Practices for Trailers

The following are some best practices for trailers uploaded for your world(s):

* Give users a preview of your content’s visuals, mechanics, and experience.
* Keep different device screen ratios in mind. Important information should be front-and-center in your trailer.
