# Providing your intended world audience when publishing

As a Horizon creator, you’re all about crafting amazing experiences for your community. To help us better understand who you worlds are designed for, you are required to identify the content rating as an additional step before publishing or republishing your world. This quick and easy step will help ensure that your creations reach the right people and provide age-appropriate experiences for everyone.

## Determining your world’s content rating

To determine the content rating for your world, review the [FTC Guidelines](https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/resources/complying-coppa-frequently-asked-questions#D.%20Websites%20and%20Online%20Services) and consider a world’s subject matter. This includes visual, character choices, child-oriented activities or incentives, music or other audio content, language, and use of child models.

You may also evaluate empirical evidence regarding audience composition or appeal to determine which content rating group is most accurate. Note that you are required to indicate your world’s content rating before the world can be published.

## How to provide your world’s content rating information

To provide your world’s content rating information, follow these steps:

- Open the Meta Horizon Worlds Desktop Editor app.
- Select your world project.
- From the upper right corner, select the **Edit world details** icon.
- Click **Specs & ratings**.
- Click **Get rating** to open the **Rate your world** modal.
- Follow the survey instructions and click **Done** when finished.

When you’ve finished, the world will have one of the following content rating:

* Ages 10+
* Ages 13+
