# Manage your team

As you build your empire of worlds, you’ll find that it’s easier to work with a team. A team represents the company or individual associated with their worlds, and the team’s name is shown with the world in the Meta Horizon Store. You can use the Developer Dashboard to create and manage teams and the members associated with of your teams.

Currently, new teams can only be created for groups that want to make stand-alone VR apps and games on the Meta Horizon Store. As a world creator, all your worlds are owned by a single team, named after your Meta Horizon username in the following format: **Meta Horizon username’s team**.

**Note**: Currently, you can’t delete your worlds team.

## Add members and roles to your team

After you’ve created your team, you can invite members into your team and assign them roles. A member may have more than one role. The roles you assign to members in your team can drive important decisions, actions, settings changes, and notifications. Think carefully when adding members and updating their roles.

### Assinging roles

Roles grant your members the permissions required to manage aspects of app development, marketing, and monetization. Members cannot access data or functions that are not permitted by their role or roles.

Currently, the available roles are:

* **Collaborator**: Can view and publish versions to all collaborators, testers and any added release channels. Can’t publish to production.
* **Publisher**: Can view and publish versions to all collaborators, testers and any added release channels. Allows publishing of worlds to Production.

### Assigning projects

Because all of your worlds are owned by a single team in the Developer Dashboard, you can assign specific projects to team members when assigning roles. This way you can ensure that the right team members have the access they need to the projects you want them to work on, without giving them those same roles and permissions across all your worlds.

### Inviting members

Each person you invite as a member into your team must have a Meta account. You must know either their Meta username or their email address. Prospective members receive an email invitation to join your team. They are not considered members of your team until they log into the Developer Dashboard and accept the invitation. A person may belong to more than one team.

NOTE

Your team is responsible for the compliance of all team members with our Terms of Service and Developer Non-Disclosure Agreement.
