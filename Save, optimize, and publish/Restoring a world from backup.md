# Restoring a world from backup

Meta Horizon Worlds periodically creates backups of your worlds while you are editing them, allowing you to revert your world to an earlier state. You can manage world backups in the Developer Dashboard or in the desktop editor.

## Restoring a world from backup in the desktop editor

In the desktop editor, you can view the list of backups, edit names and descriptions of backups, and restore previous backups of your worlds.

To manage your backups in the desktop editor:

- Open Meta Horizon Worlds in Desktop Mode from the Meta Quest Link app on your PC.
- Click the **My worlds** tab in the left navigation bar.
- Choose the world you would like to restore from backup, select the three dots next to it, and choose **Backups**. A list of backups for that world appears. By default, each backup is labeled with the date and time it was created. You can edit the name and description of each backup by clicking the pencil icon next to it.
