# Publish your world

## Publish your world using the Developer Dashboard

As a world builder, using the [Developer Dashboard](https://developers.meta.com/horizon/manage/worlds) unlocks new functionality for you and your team. You can use the Developer Dashboard to publish your world, create a store page, create and manage assets, manage payments for you and your team, access user and performance analytics, and more.

### Prerequisites

Before you can publish your world using the Developer Dashboard, you must:

* Have a Meta account and set up a development team. For more information, see [Manage your team](/hw-docs/save-optimize-and-publish/worlds-manage-team/).

### Uploading your build

Whenever you create a new world in the Horizon Desktop Editor, that world will be available on the worlds page of the [Developer Dashboard](https://developers.meta.com/horizon/manage/worlds). As you work on your worlds in Horizon Studio, they will be automatically updated in the Developer Dashboard as well.

### Publishing your world

To publish your world using the Developer Dashboard:

- Open the [Developer Dashboard](https://developers.meta.com/horizon/manage/worlds).
- Select the world you want to publish.
- From the **World product detail page** of your world, click **Continue submission**.
