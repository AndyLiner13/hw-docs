# Feedback tool

With the feedback tool, you can report bugs, submit feedback, and provide suggestions directly to Meta’s product teams, ensuring your input influences product development.

Additionally, the tool provides transparency on how Meta handles your feedback, offering updates as we review, prioritize, and implement your recommendations.

Submit feedback when you:

* Encounter bugs or issues
* Have suggestions for new features and improvements
* Want to leave general feedback about Meta’s tools, SDKs, or services

Your feedback is used to improve the product for everyone. It is not the correct channel to address individual technical concerns, and Meta can’t respond to these. For individual support, use options such as the [Meta Horizon Developer Forums](https://communityforums.atmeta.com/t5/Developer-Forums/ct-p/developer).

All information provided is used in accordance with our [Privacy Policy](https://www.meta.com/legal/privacy-policy/), and includes information such as your user ID, device ID, IP address, location, and any additional information and logs you choose to include.
