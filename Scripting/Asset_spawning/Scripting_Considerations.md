# Scripting Considerations

  
## Naming conflicts

 When spawning content it is possible to attempt to load two different scripts
with the same name causing a naming conflict. This can happen when a world
contains a script and then spawns content containing a script with the same name, or if
two pieces of content are spawned both containing scripts with the same name.
For file-backed scripts worlds see the [documentation page](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/typescript/filebacked-scripts) for details on execution specifics. In other worlds all scripts will be
executed. In both cases a warning will be logged to the scripting console. If there is a naming conflict on a script that is imported from another script,
the first loaded version of the imported script will get imported. For example,
say there is a world containing a script called `Utils` and an asset containing a script called `Utils` and a script called `Component` which contains the line `import {Foo} from './Utils'`. If the world spawns that asset, when `Component` runs it will be importing from the `Utils` script in the world, not the asset. In general it is recommended to avoid naming conflicts as they can lead to
unexpected or difficult to understand behavior.    ![Nav Logo](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/yE/r/3SoBlk8EqOQ.svg)
