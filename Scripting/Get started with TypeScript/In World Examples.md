# In World Examples

## Horizon TypeScript Templates

There are 4 world templates available to help you create starter worlds. Templates allow you to choose a theme and begin learning with a single click.

**Note:** These templates use some calls and events that may not be considered best practices today e.g., HorizonEvent vs LocalEvent or NetworkEvent. Templates will be updated periodically to adhere to latest best practices and performance optimizations.

**Follow these steps:**

- Navigate to the Horizon “Create New World” page.
- Scroll down to section **TypeScript Environments**.
- Select the template world you want to create and click Create world. <details>

### A: TypeScript and Code Block Example Scripts

This template world is an expansion of the Code Block Example Scripts template. Each example has both a TypeScript and Code Block implementation and a station to experience those next to each other. If you are familiar with using Code Blocks, the examples show common use cases for both CodeBlocks and TypeScript.

### Overview
The image depicts a virtual room resembling a conference hall or a meeting space. The room has a modern design with a large central screen displaying a circular graphic with the word "Transform" below it. There are multiple podiums arranged in a semi-circular pattern facing the screen. The room has large windows allowing natural light to enter, and the walls are painted in a bright teal color. 

### Key Elements
- **Central Screen**: Located at the back of the room, displaying a blue circle with a smaller blue circle inside, and the word "Transform" written below it.
- **Podiums**: Arranged in a semi-circle in front of the screen, each podium has a small display screen showing various names or titles.
- **Windows**: Large windows on both sides of the room, allowing natural light to illuminate the space.
- **Columns**: Tall, gray columns supporting the ceiling, located on either side of the room.
- **Signage**: A sign on the left side of the room reads "First Day" with additional text underneath that is not fully legible.
- **Flooring**: The floor is a gradient of light blue and pink, with a darker blue area in the foreground.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual element is the central screen, which draws attention due to its size and the bold text displayed. The podiums are arranged symmetrically around the screen, creating a sense of balance. The columns frame the room, adding structural integrity and aesthetic appeal. The windows provide a contrast to the solid interior elements, introducing a sense of openness. The signage on the left adds context to the setting, suggesting a formal event or presentation.

### B: TypeScript Events

Events enable objects in your world to interact with one another through an attached script. There are several types of events available in Horizon that cover communications across TypeScript and CodeBlock scripts. This template will help you learn about the event types introduced with TypeScript (**Local**, **CodeBlock**, and **Broadcast** events).

The template complements the Horizon events documentation [here](../Events/Local%20Events.md). This template covers:

* Horizon **Local**, **CodeBlock**, and **Broadcast** events
* Players present board and text gizmo updates
* Creating events and subscribing to events
* Interactions and events detection and world updates

### Overview
The image depicts a virtual environment resembling a modern, possibly futuristic, indoor setting. The space has a clean, open layout with a mix of geometric shapes and smooth surfaces. There are various interactive elements and informational signs within the scene.

### Key Elements
- **Left Panel**: Contains a circular sign with the text "Horizon Events" in a yellow banner. Below it, there are two smaller informational signs mounted on poles.
- **Center**: A red carpet leads towards a control panel with a red button and a screen displaying some information. To the left of the control panel, there are barriers with a red and black design.
- **Right Panel**: Features a large, circular object with a metallic finish and a central knob, positioned near the ceiling.
- **Background**: The walls are light green, and the ceiling has a blue hue with a geometric pattern.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual elements are the signs and the control panel. The red carpet guides the viewer's eye towards the control panel, which is the focal point of interaction. The circular object on the right seems to be a decorative or functional element, adding to the futuristic aesthetic of the room.

- **Walls**: Plain, light-colored surfaces with minimal decoration.
- **Floor**: Tiled, light gray with grid lines, suggesting a clean, industrial look.
- **Text**: "Welcome to THE LAB" prominently displayed in the center of the wall facing the viewer.
- **Icons**: Small, colorful cubes are scattered around the room, particularly near the right wall.
- **Door**: A large, teal arch-shaped door is centered in the wall facing the viewer.
- **Text on Right Wall**: "Asset (De)Spawner" written vertically along the right wall.
- **Foreground Object**: A small, pixelated figure stands near the center of the room, facing away from the viewer.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual element is the "Welcome to THE LAB" text, which draws attention as the focal point. The door serves as another significant visual element, leading the viewer's eye towards the entrance. The scattered cubes add a sense of activity or purpose within the space. The overall layout suggests a structured, organized environment.

### D: Modules

TypeScript modules are an exciting new addition to Horizon scripting. They let you write code that is not attached to objects. Modules can be used by other scripts in the world. They allow encapsulation and define a set of behavior in the same file, promoting readability.

* Simple “Hello World” implementation
* Simple math library that can be used by other scripts
* More complex data store example showcasing how to force a single global instance of a script

- **Interior Panels**: Inside the structure, there are four vertical panels with text and diagrams. Each panel has a light pink base and dark purple upper sections containing text and small illustrations.
- **Text and Diagrams**: The panels contain various texts and diagrams, though the specific content is not legible due to resolution limitations.
- **Colorful Shapes**: Above the structure, there are four groups of geometric shapes in blue, green, red, and yellow. These shapes are arranged symmetrically, with two groups on either side of the structure.
- **Background**: The background features a dark, starry sky with spherical objects resembling planets or moons, adding to the futuristic ambiance.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
- **Most Prominent Element**: The "Modules Demo" structure is the most prominent visual element.
- **Arrows/Connections**: There are no explicit arrows or connections within the image itself.
- **Spatial Relationships**: The colorful shapes above the structure are positioned symmetrically, creating a balanced layout. The interior panels are evenly spaced within the structure.
