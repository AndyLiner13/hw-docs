## Content

### Overview
This image depicts a user interface element, specifically a settings panel or configuration screen, likely part of a software application. It includes a header labeled "HintText:HintText," followed by several adjustable font sizes for different text types.

### Key Elements
- **Header**: Located at the top-left corner, reads "HintText:HintText."
- **Input Field**: Positioned below the header, contains the text "0." This field appears to be editable.
- **Toggle Switches**: Two toggle switches are present beneath the input field. They are labeled "openSFX" and "closeSFX," both showing the same audio graph icon and a circular toggle switch indicator.
- **Font Size Settings**: Below the toggle switches, there are six adjustable font size settings labeled as "smallTitleFontSize," "smallMessageFontSize," "normalTitleFontSize," "normalMessageFontSize," "bigTitleFontSize," and "bigMessageFontSize." Each setting has a corresponding value displayed next to it.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The layout is structured with a clear vertical arrangement. The header is the most prominent element, followed by the input field, then the toggle switches, and finally the font size settings. There are no arrows or lines connecting elements, suggesting a linear reading order from top to bottom.
