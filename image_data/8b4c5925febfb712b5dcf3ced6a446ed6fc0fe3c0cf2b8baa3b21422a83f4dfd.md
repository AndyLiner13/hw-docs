- **Search Bar**: Positioned below the header, it has a magnifying glass icon on the left side and a black background.
- **Settings Icon**: A gear icon is located to the right of the search bar.
- **Create New Script Button**: A gray button with the text "Create new script" is situated at the bottom of the "Scripts" section.

- **Close Button**: An "X" icon is located at the top-right corner of the "Scripts" section, indicating the ability to close the panel.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual element is the "Create new script" button, as it is centrally located and designed to draw attention. The search bar and settings icon are secondary elements that provide functionality but are less visually dominant. The empty state message serves as a placeholder when no scripts exist, guiding the user to take action.
