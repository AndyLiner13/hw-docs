## Content

### Overview
This image depicts a user interface element resembling a form or settings panel within a software application. It includes a header, input fields, and a small icon indicating a dropdown or expandable section.

### Key Elements
- **Header**: Located at the top-left corner, it contains a small icon (a triangle with a dot inside) and the text "TutorialImageInfo:Tutorialim..." which seems to be truncated.
- **Input Fields**: Two rectangular input fields are present below the header. The first field has the label "order" and is filled with the number "1". The second field is labeled "imageId" but is empty.
- **Icon**: A small icon resembling a dropdown arrow is positioned next to the header, suggesting that clicking it would reveal more options or information related to the "TutorialImageInfo" section.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual element is the header due to its placement at the top. The input fields are arranged vertically below the header. There are no arrows or lines connecting elements, implying a linear reading order from top to bottom.
