## Content

### Overview
The image depicts a user interface of a digital art or design software. The central focus is a generated image of a snowy landscape with a tunnel leading into a glowing light source, set against a vibrant aurora borealis in the sky. On the right side, there are AI-generated suggestions for similar scenes. The bottom left shows a file explorer with folders and assets related to the project.

### Key Elements
- **Central Scene**: A snowy mountainous landscape with a tunnel leading into a glowing light source. The aurora borealis dominates the sky, with green, yellow, and purple hues.
- **Right Panel**: Contains AI-generated suggestions labeled "Horizon AI." Each suggestion includes a thumbnail image of a snowy landscape with auroras.
- **Bottom Left**: A file explorer with folders named "My Assets" and "Shared With Me," showing various asset thumbnails labeled with filenames such as "generated_skybox_32..." and "jee_test_skybox."

### Visual Flow / Relationships
- The most prominent visual is the central scene, which draws attention due to its vivid colors and dynamic lighting.
- Arrows or lines are not present, but the layout suggests a sequential flow from the central scene to the AI suggestions and then to the file explorer.
