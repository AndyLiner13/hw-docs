### Overview
This image depicts a user interface section of a software application, likely related to development or testing, given the presence of options for previewing device models and local environments. The interface includes dropdown menus, buttons, and navigation tabs at the top.

### Key Elements
- **Top Navigation Bar**: Located at the very top, spans the width of the interface. Contains tabs labeled "Build," "Systems," "Preview," "Scripts," and "Gen AI." The "Preview" tab is highlighted, suggesting it is currently active.
- **Dropdown Menu**: Positioned below the "Preview" tab, it is open and displays options "Mobile," "Web," and "None." The dropdown has a dark gray background with white text.
- **Device Model Dropdown**: Situated next to the "Preview device" label, it features a phone icon and a downward arrow indicating a dropdown menu.
- **More Options Button**: Located to the right of the device model dropdown, it has a gear icon and a downward arrow, suggesting additional settings or configurations.
- **Local Environment Dropdown**: Found on the far right, it has a globe icon and a downward arrow, indicating a dropdown for selecting local environments.
- **Tool Buttons**: Below the dropdowns, there are several icons representing different tools or functions, such as a blue square with a white cursor, a plus sign, a cube, and a square with a line through it.
- **Search Bar**: Partially visible on the left side, with a magnifying glass icon and the word "Search" next to it.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual element is the open dropdown menu under the "Preview" tab. The dropdown menu is the focal point due to its size and the fact that it is expanded. The tool buttons below the dropdowns are arranged horizontally, and the search bar is positioned to the left. The layout suggests a linear reading order moving from left to right.
