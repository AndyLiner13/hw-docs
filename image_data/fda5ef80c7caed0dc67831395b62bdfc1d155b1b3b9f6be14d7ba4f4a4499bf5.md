## Content

### Overview
This image depicts a settings interface titled "Script Settings." It is a modal window with a dark theme, likely part of a software application. The interface includes a sidebar with navigation options ("API," "Console," "Script editing") and a main content area displaying API settings. The main content area has a list of API endpoints with toggle switches next to them.

### Key Elements
- **Sidebar Navigation**: Located on the left side, with options "API," "Console," and "Script editing." Each option is a clickable link.
- **Main Content Area**: Positioned centrally, showing API settings. Contains a header "API" and a list of API endpoints.
  - **API Version**: Displayed as "2.0.0" at the top right.
  - **API Endpoints List**: A vertical list of API endpoints such as "horizon/in_world_analytics," "horizon/internal," "horizon/mobile_gestures," etc. Each endpoint has a toggle switch next to it.
    - **Toggles**: Toggle switches are located on the far right of each line item. Some toggles are checked (indicated by a blue background), while others are unchecked (white background).
    - **Highlighted Toggle**: The toggle switch for "horizon/navmesh" is highlighted with a red bounding box, indicating it is currently selected or focused.
- **Buttons**: At the bottom of the interface, there are two buttons labeled "Cancel" and "Apply."

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The interface follows a linear flow from left to right and top to bottom. The sidebar navigation is the primary menu, directing the user to different sections. The main content area displays the API settings, with the API version at the top and the list of endpoints below. The toggle switches allow users to enable or disable specific APIs. The "Apply" button suggests that changes can be saved, while the "Cancel" button likely resets the interface to its previous state.
