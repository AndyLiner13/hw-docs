## Content

### Overview
This image depicts a 3D modeling software interface, specifically a scene view within a game engine or similar development environment. The central area displays a blue sky gradient with a white cube placed on a tiled floor grid. The left side shows a hierarchical list of objects, while the right side contains properties for selected objects.

### Key Elements
- **Central Scene View**: A large rectangular area displaying a blue sky gradient transitioning to lighter shades at the bottom. A white cube is centered in the scene.
- **Scene Floor**: A tiled floor grid in light gray, extending across the bottom of the scene view.
- **Hierarchy Panel**: Located on the left, showing a list of objects with icons next to them. Examples include "Sphere," "[Environment]," "aaa '_______ 3," "Gravity Cone," and others.
- **Properties Panel**: On the right, it prompts users to "Select an object to view its properties." There are no currently selected objects shown.
- **Top Bar**: Contains various icons and options such as play, pause, transform, and publish buttons.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual element is the central scene view. The hierarchy panel on the left and the properties panel on the right provide contextual information and allow interaction with the scene. The scene view is the focal point, with the cube being the primary object of interest.
