## Content

### Overview
The image presents four different visual representations of a stone-paved surface, each labeled with a specific process or technique applied to it. The layout is arranged in a grid format, with each quadrant showcasing a distinct aspect of the model's development and rendering.

### Key Elements
1. **Hi-Res Model / Sculpt**
   - **Visual description**: A high-resolution model of a stone-paved surface.
   - **Location**: Top-left quadrant.
   - **Contents**: The surface is composed of numerous polygons, indicated by the white squares forming a grid-like pattern.
   - **Visual styling**: Gray background, white polygons, no additional elements.

2. **Low-Res Model**
   - **Visual description**: A low-resolution model of the same stone-paved surface.
   - **Location**: Top-center quadrant.
   - **Contents**: The surface is represented with fewer polygons, shown as a triangular mesh.
   - **Visual styling**: Gray background, black triangles forming a mesh pattern.

3. **Texture Baking**
   - **Visual description**: A rendered image showing the result of texture baking.
   - **Location**: Bottom-left quadrant.
   - **Contents**: The surface appears more detailed than the low-res model but less detailed than the hi-res model. It includes textures that simulate the look of stone with some wear and tear.
   - **Visual styling**: Black background, white and gray stones with some dark spots indicating wear.

4. **Silhouette + Texture**
   - **Visual description**: A rendered image combining a silhouette with textured detail.
   - **Location**: Bottom-right quadrant.
   - **Contents**: The surface is depicted with a clear silhouette of the stones against a light background, overlaid with detailed textures that enhance the realism of the stones.
   - **Visual styling**: Light background, white and gray stones with detailed textures.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
- **Most prominent visually**: The Hi-Res Model / Sculpt is the most detailed and complex, highlighting the highest level of polygon count.
- **Arrows, lines, connectors**: None.
- **Spatial relationships**: Each quadrant is distinct and clearly separated, with no overlapping or connecting elements.
