## Content

### Overview
This image depicts a dialog box with two radio button options for selecting a trace type. The box is set against a hexagonal tiled floor background with pink confetti scattered around. The dialog box has a dark gray background with white text and blue accents.

### Key Elements
- **Title**: "Start a trace" displayed at the top of the dialog box.
- **Question**: "What type of trace do you want to run?" located below the title.
- **Options**:
  - **Overview**: A radio button option labeled "Overview" with a description underneath stating, "Set a baseline for how your world performs in visit mode. Viewable in Perfetto."
  - **Deep**: Another radio button option labeled "Deep" with a description underneath stating, "Uncover possible ways to optimize parts of your world. Viewable in Perfetto."
- **Buttons**:
  - **Start capture**: A blue button with white text that says "Start capture" located on the right side of the dialog box.
  - **Cancel**: A gray button with white text that says "Cancel" located at the bottom left of the dialog box.
- **Close Button**: A small white "X" icon located at the top right corner of the dialog box.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual element is the dialog box itself. The radio buttons are arranged vertically under the question, with the "Deep" option currently selected as indicated by the blue dot next to it. The "Start capture" button is positioned to the right of the dialog box, while the "Cancel" button is at the bottom left. There are no arrows or lines connecting the elements, but the layout suggests a linear reading order moving from the question, through the options, and ending with the buttons.
