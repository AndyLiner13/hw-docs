## Content

### Overview
This image depicts a user interface for scripting within a game development environment. The interface shows a script editor with a sequence of blocks representing conditional logic and variable interactions. The background is dark, and the blocks are arranged horizontally across the screen.

### Key Elements
- **Top Bar**: Located at the very top, this bar contains the title "Script1" and several icons for settings, duplication, and closing the window.
- **Script Editor**: Occupies the central area of the interface. It displays a series of interconnected blocks forming a script sequence.
    - **Block 1**: "when world is entered by player" with a green icon of a player character.
    - **Block 2**: "set Select persistent variable to get persistent variable"
    - **Block 3**: "Select persistent variable value for player"
- **Empty Area**: Below the blocks, there is a large empty space that likely serves as the canvas for adding more blocks or viewing the script execution.
- **Status Bar**: At the bottom, there is a green checkmark indicating "No Errors," followed by "Script Mode: Default." On the right side, there is a "Script Capacity" indicator showing "1%."

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The blocks are arranged in a linear sequence, suggesting a step-by-step process. There are no arrows or lines connecting the blocks, implying a direct flow from one block to the next. The blocks are aligned horizontally, and the empty area below them suggests a space for further script construction.
