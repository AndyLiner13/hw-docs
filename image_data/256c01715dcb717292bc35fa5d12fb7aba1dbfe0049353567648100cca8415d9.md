## Content

### Overview
This image depicts a user interface screen titled "Generate voices." It features a dark-themed design with a central prompt area and a list of voice generation options. The screen includes interactive buttons for generating specific voice types and a text input field at the bottom for describing voice characteristics.

### Key Elements
- **Title**: "Generate voices" located at the top-center of the screen.
- **Central Prompt Area**: A light gray circle with a starburst design in the center, accompanied by the text: "Enter a prompt to generate voices. Preview, save, and assign them to your NPC."
- **Interactive Buttons**: Seven rectangular buttons below the prompt area, each labeled with a different voice type:
  - "Generate an old, ancient voice"
  - "Generate a bouncy, happy voice"
  - "Generate an adventurous, brave voice"
  - "Generate a growling, scary voice"
  - "Generate a monotone, robot voice"
  - "Generate an absurd, crazy voice"
  - "Generate a rough, coarse voice"
- **Text Input Field**: Located at the bottom of the screen, labeled "Describe a voice's tone, pacing, and personality."
- **Generate Button**: A blue button with white text labeled "Generate" situated to the right of the text input field.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual element is the central prompt area with the starburst design. The interactive buttons are arranged vertically beneath the prompt area. The text input field is positioned at the very bottom, and the Generate button is aligned to its right. There are no arrows or lines connecting elements, but the layout suggests a sequential process starting with entering a prompt, selecting a voice type, and then generating the voice.
