## Content

### Overview
This image depicts a user interface section of a settings or configuration page, likely within a web application or software tool. It shows toggle switches and a prominent blue "Publish" button.

### Key Elements
- **Toggle Switches**: Two toggle switches are located at the top right. They appear to control features related to the world being managed. The switches are off, indicated by the grayed-out state.
- **Text Labels**: Above the toggle switches, there are labels describing the toggles' functions:
  - "Members-only world"
  - "Optimized for Web and Mobile"
- **"Publish" Button**: A large blue rectangular button labeled "Publish" is prominently displayed at the bottom. It is outlined with a red dashed border, suggesting it is the primary action to take.
- **Background**: The background is dark gray, providing contrast to the lighter-colored text and buttons.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual element is the "Publish" button due to its size and placement. The toggle switches are secondary elements, positioned above the button. There are no arrows or lines connecting the elements, but the layout suggests a linear reading order moving from top to bottom.
