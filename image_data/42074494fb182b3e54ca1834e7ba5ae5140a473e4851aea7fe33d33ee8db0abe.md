## Content

### Overview
This image depicts a user interface from a game development environment, specifically showing a scene view alongside a hierarchy panel. The scene view displays a 3D environment with a grid floor and walls, featuring several blue cube markers scattered throughout. The hierarchy panel on the left lists various game objects and assets, with some items expanded to reveal more details.

### Key Elements
- **Hierarchy Panel**: Located on the left side, it has a dark background with white text. It lists game objects and assets under categories such as "SpawnPoint," "[Environment]," and "PlayerCameraCore." Some items are expanded, revealing additional details like "[DEV] CameraTriggerText."
- **Scene View**: On the right, it shows a 3D environment with a grid floor and walls. Two characters are standing in the room, facing each other. Blue cube markers are distributed across the scene, some appearing to be interactive elements.
- **Title**: At the top of the scene view, the title "PlayerCamera Core" is displayed prominently in white text against a light blue gradient background.
- **Navigation Controls**: At the top-right corner, there are various navigation controls including options for local/center alignment, rotation, scale, and camera settings.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The hierarchy panel is the most prominent element on the left, while the scene view occupies the majority of the right side. The blue cube markers in the scene view are evenly distributed, suggesting they might be part of the level design or interactive elements. The characters in the scene appear to be static models, possibly placeholders or NPCs. The navigation controls at the top-right provide tools for manipulating the scene view.
