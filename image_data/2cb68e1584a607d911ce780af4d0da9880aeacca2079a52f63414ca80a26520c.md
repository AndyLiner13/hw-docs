### Overview
This image depicts a mobile game interface showing a puzzle stage titled "Abilities." The main focus is a grid-based puzzle area filled with various colored tiles representing different shapes and colors. Below the puzzle grid, there's a notification indicating that a booster has been tapped, prompting the player to tap a tile to use it. At the bottom, there's a character standing next to a home icon, likely a navigation button. The top of the screen displays the goal number (4), score (2520), moves remaining (23), and a settings gear icon.

### Key Elements
- **Puzzle Grid**: A large rectangular grid filled with colorful tiles. Tiles include hexagons, triangles, and diamonds in red, purple, blue, green, orange, and pink.
- **Notification Box**: Located at the bottom of the screen, it reads: "You've tapped a booster! Tap a tile to use it."
- **Character**: A male figure dressed in a suit stands to the left of the notification box.
- **Home Icon**: A yellow house icon with an upward arrow is positioned at the bottom center of the screen.
- **Score and Moves**: Displayed at the top right, showing "Score: 2520" and "Moves: 23."
- **Goal**: Located at the top left, indicating "Goal: 4."

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual element is the puzzle grid, which occupies the central part of the screen. The notification box draws attention due to its placement below the grid and its contrasting color. The character and home icon are secondary elements, providing context and functionality within the game interface. The score and moves indicators are static elements placed at the top corners, serving as informational overlays.
