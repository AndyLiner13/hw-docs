### Overview
This image depicts a user interface of a 3D modeling software. The central area shows a 3D scene with a red sphere placed on a grid floor against a gradient sky background. On the right side, there is a panel displaying asset details and version information. The left sidebar contains a hierarchical menu with various options such as "Hierarchy," "Assets," "Console," and "Tests." At the bottom, there is a grid of thumbnail previews labeled with asset names.

### Key Elements
- **Central Scene**: A 3D view showing a red sphere on a grid floor with a gradient sky background.

- **Left Sidebar**: Hierarchical menu with options like "Hierarchy," "Assets," "Console," and "Tests."
- **Bottom Grid**: A grid of thumbnail previews with labels such as "Test Metadata," "Test Model," "Test Library," etc.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual element is the central 3D scene. The right panel provides additional information about the selected asset. The left sidebar offers navigation options, and the bottom grid displays a collection of assets. There are no arrows or lines connecting elements, but the layout suggests a typical workflow where users navigate through different panels to manage and view assets.
