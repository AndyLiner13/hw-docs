## Content

### Overview
This image depicts a 3D modeling software interface, specifically showing a scene with a red sphere placed on a grid floor against a blue sky backdrop. The interface includes various panels and tools for asset management and scene manipulation.

### Key Elements
- **Scene View**: Located centrally, displaying a 3D environment with a red sphere on a grid floor and a blue sky background.
- **Sphere**: A red sphere located near the center of the scene view.
- **Scene Tools**: Two icons are visible above the sphere in the scene view. These appear to be tools for manipulating the scene, possibly for adding or modifying objects.
- **Asset Panel**: On the right side, there is a panel labeled "Asset detail" which contains information about an asset named "apple.smg". It includes fields such as "Asset Type", "Version", "Created", and "Updated By".
- **Hierarchy Panel**: At the bottom left, there is a panel titled "Hierarchy" listing assets under categories like "My Folders", "My Assets", and others.
- **Navigation Bar**: At the top, there is a navigation bar with tabs labeled "Local", "Center", and "Right".

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual element is the scene view, which occupies the central area of the interface. The red sphere is the focal point within the scene. The asset panel on the right provides contextual information about the selected asset, while the hierarchy panel at the bottom left lists the assets available in the project. The navigation bar at the top allows switching between different views of the scene.
