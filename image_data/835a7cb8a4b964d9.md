### Overview
The image depicts a user interface of a 3D modeling or game development software environment. The central area shows a 3D workspace with a grid floor and walls, suggesting a scene setup or level design. The top bar contains various menu options and tools related to building, scripting, and system management. On the right side, there's a collaborative feature panel indicating no collaborators yet but showing an invitation status.

### Key Elements
- **Left Panel**: Contains a sidebar labeled "Hierarchy" with expandable categories such as "Spawn Point," "emerald," "Completed Scripts," and "Environment." There’s also a search bar at the top of this panel.
- **Central Workspace**: A large blue sky and yellow wall grid, representing a 3D scene view. The word "Start" is prominently displayed in the center of the scene.
- **Top Bar**: Features menu options like "Build," "Systems," "Scripts," and "Gen AI." There are also playback controls and a Unity view indicator.
- **Right Panel**: Displays a "Collaborators" section with a single invite shown ("nmontefusco (You)"). It indicates that no collaborators are currently added and suggests inviting others to collaborate.
- **Bottom Notification**: A black notification bar at the bottom confirms that a collaborator invite has been sent successfully.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The layout follows a typical software interface with a sidebar, central workspace, and a tool bar at the top. The workspace is the focal point, with the collaborative panel on the right providing additional functionality. The notification at the bottom is a pop-up confirming the action taken.
