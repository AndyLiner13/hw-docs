## Content

### Overview
This image depicts a 3D modeling software interface showing a scene with several geometric shapes. The left side displays a hierarchical structure of objects, while the right side shows a 3D view of the scene.

### Key Elements
- **Left Panel**: Contains a hierarchical structure with expandable nodes labeled as `SpawnPoint`, `EntityGroup`, `Plastic_03`, `Star_03`, and `Wedge`. The nodes are arranged vertically.
- **Scene View**: Located on the right, displaying a 3D environment with a grid floor and a sky background. Three geometric shapes are visible: a cone, a cube, and a star.
- **Cursor**: A small white arrow is positioned near the bottom of the scene view, indicating interaction point.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual elements are the hierarchical structure on the left and the 3D scene on the right. The cursor suggests user interaction within the scene view. There are no arrows or lines connecting elements, but the layout implies a logical progression from the structure to the visualization.
