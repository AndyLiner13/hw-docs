## Content

### Overview
The image depicts a user interface from a game development environment, specifically showing a scene preview and a sidebar with various tools and options. The scene preview displays a foggy graveyard at night, with tombstones and a small building in the foreground. A semi-transparent overlay window titled "Leaderboards" is open, providing instructions related to defining world-specific leaderboards.

### Key Elements
- **Scene Preview**: Located centrally, showing a graveyard scene with tombstones, a small building, and a purple-hued sky with a glowing pink light. The ground is dark and textured to resemble dirt or gravel.
- **Overlay Window**: Positioned on the left side of the screen, with a dark background and light text. Contains a trophy icon and the text "> Define world-specific leaderboards here, then use them in scripts." The window has a semi-transparent effect.
- **Sidebar**: On the left side, contains a tree-like structure with nodes labeled "Navigation," "quests," "Variable Groups," and "Leaderboards." The "Leaderboards" node is expanded, revealing a sub-node named "MyFirstWorld."
- **Properties Panel**: On the right side, currently empty, with a placeholder message "Select an object to view its properties."
- **Navigation Bar**: At the bottom, includes tabs labeled "Hierarchy," "Asset Library," "Console," "Tests," "NPC Debugger," and "Performance."

### Visual Flow / Relationships
- The most prominent visual element is the scene preview, as it occupies the largest area of the screen.
- The overlay window is secondary but important for providing instructions.
- The sidebar and properties panel are supplementary, offering additional functionality and information.
- There are no explicit arrows or lines connecting elements, but the layout suggests a hierarchical relationship between the sidebar nodes and the scene preview.
