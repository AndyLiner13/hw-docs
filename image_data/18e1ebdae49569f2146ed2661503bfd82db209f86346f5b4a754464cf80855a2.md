### Overview
The image depicts a user interface from a game development environment, specifically showing a scene preview and a sidebar with various tools and options. The scene preview displays a foggy graveyard at night, with tombstones and a small building in the foreground. A semi-transparent overlay window titled "Leaderboards" is open, providing instructions related to defining world-specific leaderboards.

### Key Elements

- **Overlay Window**: Positioned on the left side of the screen, with a dark background and light text. Contains a trophy icon and the text "> Define world-specific leaderboards here, then use them in scripts." The window has a semi-transparent effect.
- **Sidebar**: On the left side, contains a vertical menu with items such as "Hierarchy," "Navigation," "quests," "Variable Groups," and "Leaderboards." The "Leaderboards" option is highlighted, indicating it is currently active.
- **Properties Panel**: On the right side, partially visible, with a placeholder message "Select an object to view its properties."

### Visual Flow / Relationships
- **Most Prominent Element**: The scene preview in the center.
- **Arrows/Connectors**: None visible.
- **Reading Order**: The user would typically read from left to right, starting with the sidebar, then moving to the scene preview, and finally interacting with the properties panel if needed.
