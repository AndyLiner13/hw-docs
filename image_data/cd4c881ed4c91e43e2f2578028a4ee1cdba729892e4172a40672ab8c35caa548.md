### Overview
The image displays a user interface overlaying a game environment. It includes performance metrics, utility options, and a notification card. The performance metrics show FPS, CPU, and GPU statistics. Utility options include "Real-time metrics" and "Tracing." A notification card for "Arena Clash" is also visible.

### Key Elements

- **Utilities Menu**: Positioned centrally, offering options like "Real-time metrics" and "Tracing."
- **Notification Card**: On the right, displaying "Arena Clash," the time "1:22 PM," and a "New" badge with a red dot indicating unread notifications.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual elements are the performance metrics panel and the utilities menu. The notification card is less prominent but still noticeable due to its bright blue color and the "New" badge. There are no arrows or lines connecting these elements, suggesting a flat layout without a specific reading order.
