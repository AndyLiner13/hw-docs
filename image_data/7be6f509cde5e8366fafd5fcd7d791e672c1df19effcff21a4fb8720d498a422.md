- **Error Message**: A red error message box at the bottom center of the screen displays a meta-only horizon error indicating a failure to find and create a panel.
- **Asset Information Panel**: Located on the right side, this panel shows details about the asset "UICDiff," including its ID, owner, creation date, and folder. It also has a placeholder for entering a description and a section for versions.
