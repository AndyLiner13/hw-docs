## Content

### Overview
The image displays a 3D modeling environment with two objects resembling rectangular prisms, one outlined in blue and the other in red. Below these objects are two cubes labeled "Script1," each featuring a stylized code snippet icon.

### Key Elements
- **Top Left Object**: A rectangular prism outlined in blue. The object has a smooth surface with rounded edges.
- **Top Right Object**: Another rectangular prism, this time outlined in red. It also has a smooth surface with rounded edges.
- **Bottom Objects**: Two cubes labeled "Script1." Each cube has a purple background with a white border. The cubes feature a stylized code snippet icon in white, located near the bottom right corner of each cube. The text "Script1" is written in white at the top left corner of each cube.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The two rectangular prisms are positioned above the two cubes. There are no arrows or lines connecting the elements, suggesting a simple display of different 3D models. The cubes are aligned horizontally beneath the prisms, creating a clear distinction between the two sets of objects.
