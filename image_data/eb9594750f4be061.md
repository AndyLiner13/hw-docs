## Content

### Overview
This image depicts a user interface for editing an avatar within a virtual environment, specifically Meta Horizon. The interface allows users to customize various aspects of their avatar, such as clothing, accessories, hair, makeup, face, and body features. The main focus is on the hairstyle customization options, which are displayed in a grid layout on the right side of the screen.

### Key Elements
- **Avatar Preview**: Located on the right side of the screen, showing a 3D model of an avatar wearing a dark t-shirt and jeans. The avatar has a hairstyle that matches one of the options selected in the hairstyle grid.
- **Hairstyle Grid**: Positioned centrally on the right side, displaying multiple hairstyles in a grid format. Each hairstyle is represented by a small 3D model of a head.
- **Clothing Section**: Located on the left side, with a dropdown menu labeled "Clothing." It includes a sub-menu for "Accessories."
- **Hair Section**: Also on the left side, with a dropdown menu labeled "Hair," currently expanded to show "Hairstyle" and "Facial hair" options.
- **Makeup Section**: Below the Hair section, with a dropdown menu labeled "Makeup."
- **Face Section**: Below the Makeup section, with a dropdown menu labeled "Face."
- **Body Section**: At the bottom of the left sidebar, with a dropdown menu labeled "Body."

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The interface is organized into a sidebar on the left and a preview area on the right. The hairstyle grid is the most prominent visual element, as it occupies a significant portion of the screen space. The avatar preview is secondary but crucial for visualizing the changes made to the avatar. The layout suggests a linear progression through the customization options, starting from the top left and moving downward.
