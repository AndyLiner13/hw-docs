## Content

### Overview
The image depicts a simple diagram illustrating directional vectors emanating from a cube. The cube is at the bottom left, and three arrows point upwards, forward, and rightward, each labeled with a direction.

### Key Elements
- **Cube**: A black-outlined cube located at the bottom-left corner.
- **Green Arrow ("up")**: Points upwards from the cube. It has a green arrowhead and is labeled "up" in green text above it.
- **Blue Arrow ("forward")**: Points diagonally upwards and to the right from the cube. It has a blue arrowhead and is labeled "forward" in blue text near its midpoint.
- **Red Arrow ("right")**: Points horizontally to the right from the cube. It has a red arrowhead and is labeled "right" in red text to its right.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
- The most prominent visual is the cube as the starting point for the arrows.
- Arrows are arranged in a triangular formation around the cube, suggesting a coordinate system or directional reference frame.
- The arrows are connected to the cube but do not overlap, maintaining clear separation.
