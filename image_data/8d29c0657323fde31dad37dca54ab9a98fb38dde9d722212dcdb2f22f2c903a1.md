## Content

### Overview
This image displays a TypeScript code snippet within a code editor environment. The code is part of a class named `GetQuestionData`, which extends `Component`. It involves event handling, property definitions, and method implementations related to question data retrieval and sending back questions along with answers.

### Key Elements
- **Visual description**: The code is written in a monospaced font typical of code editors.
- **Location**: The code spans across multiple lines, starting from line 1 and continuing down to line 43.
- **Contents**:
    - Line 1: Imports necessary modules (`CodeBlockEvent`, `Component`, `PropTypes`) from `"horizon/core"` and `UtilArray_Func`.
    - Line 4: Defines a `CodeBlockEvent` named `getNewQuestion`.
    - Line 5: Defines another `CodeBlockEvent` named `questionMessage`.
    - Line 7: Declares a class `GetQuestionData` extending `Component`.
    - Line 8: Defines static props definition.
    - Line 12: Implements `preStart()` method connecting events.
    - Line 16: Implements `start()` method.
    - Line 20: Implements `sendBackQuestion()` method.
    - Line 34: Defines an array `questionData` containing objects representing questions and answers.
    - Line 39: Defines a type `QuestionData` for the objects in `questionData`.

- **Visual styling**: The code uses syntax highlighting with keywords in blue, strings in red, and comments in green. There are no borders or special visual effects applied to the code itself.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
- **Most prominent visually**: The code blocks are clearly delineated by indentation and syntax highlighting.
- **Arrows, lines, connectors**: None.
- **Spatial relationships**: The code flows vertically from top to bottom, with methods and variables defined in a logical sequence.
