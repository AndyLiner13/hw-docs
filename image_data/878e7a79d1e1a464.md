## Content

### Overview
This image depicts a 3D modeling software interface with a menu dropdown open on the left side. The main workspace in the center shows a 3D scene with a cube and a sphere, both with selection handles indicating they are interactive objects. The grid floor and perspective view suggest a 3D modeling environment.

### Key Elements
- **Menu Dropdown**: Located on the left side, it is a black rectangular dropdown menu with white text listing options: "Create Asset," "Delete selection," "Group selection," and "Focus on selection." Each option has a corresponding keyboard shortcut next to it.
- **3D Scene**: In the center, there is a green cube with a brown roof and a white sphere. Both objects have selection handles, suggesting they can be manipulated within the 3D space.
- **Selection Handles**: Red and blue arrows appear on the sphere, indicating rotation and translation axes.
- **Grid Floor**: A light gray grid spans the entire workspace, providing a reference for object placement.
- **Perspective View**: The scene is viewed from a top-down perspective, typical of 3D modeling software.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual element is the menu dropdown, as it is the focal point of interaction. The 3D scene is secondary but crucial for understanding the context of the software. The selection handles on the objects imply that the user can interact with them, and the grid provides spatial orientation.
