## Content

### Overview
The image depicts a user interface within a 3D modeling or game development software environment. The interface includes a sidebar menu, a central workspace displaying a 3D model, and various toolbars at the bottom. The background shows a simple grid plane and a gradient sky.

### Key Elements
- **Sidebar Menu**: Located on the left side, it has a dark background with white text and icons. It lists categories such as "Build," "Shapes," "Gizmos," "Sounds," "Assets," and folders like "Awesome New Folder." The highlighted folder is "Awesome New Folder."
- **Central Workspace**: Positioned centrally, it displays a 3D model of a die with a blue bounding box around it. The model has a grayish texture with some green and red spheres attached to it. There is also a small icon labeled "HorizonDice" with a warning symbol next to it.
- **Toolbars**: At the bottom, there are several icons arranged horizontally, likely representing different tools or functions within the software. These include icons resembling a cube, a lock, a globe, a wrench, and others.
- **Background**: A simple grid plane is visible beneath the workspace, and above it is a gradient sky transitioning from light blue to darker blue.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual element is the central workspace showing the 3D model. The sidebar menu provides navigation options, and the toolbars offer functionality controls. The layout suggests a typical workflow where users can build and manipulate assets within a 3D environment.
