## Content

### Overview
This image depicts a user interface from a development environment, likely a game engine or similar software, showing performance metrics and asset management. The layout includes a sidebar, a central performance graph, and a properties panel on the right.

### Key Elements
- **Sidebar (Left Panel)**: Contains a tree-like structure labeled "Hierarchy" with nodes such as "SpawnPoint," "SmoothCylinder," and "Cube." There’s also a search bar at the bottom.
- **Performance Graph (Center)**: A large area displaying performance metrics over time. It has a timeline at the top with frame numbers and a graph showing various performance categories like "GPU," "Physics," "Scripting," "Audio," "Avatar," "Calls," "Vertices," and "Animation." Each category has a line representing its performance, with specific target and max values noted.
- **Properties Panel (Right)**: Displays a list of mesh assets under the "Assets" tab. Columns include "NAME," "USED BY MEMORY," "FORMAT," "TRIANGLES," "VERTICES," and "COUNT." The "Mesh Assets" are listed with varying memory usage and geometry details.
- **Top Bar**: Contains various icons and options such as "View," "Switch to VR," "Publish," and others related to project management and viewing modes.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual elements are the performance graph and the properties panel. The graph is centrally located, drawing attention due to its size and the highlighted section indicating a specific timeframe. The properties panel on the right provides detailed information about the assets, while the sidebar offers navigation through the project structure. The top bar provides quick access to different functionalities within the application.
