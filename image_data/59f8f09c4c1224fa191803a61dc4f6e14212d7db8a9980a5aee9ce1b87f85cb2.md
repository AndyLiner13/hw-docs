- **Left Panel**: A dark sidebar with a tree-like structure showing elements named "RoomB_Keypad," "KeypadScreen," "Digits," "DigitsPlacements," "KeypadTrigger," and several buttons labeled "Button1" to "Button9." The "RoomB_Keypad" element is expanded, revealing its child elements.
- **Right Panel**: Contains properties for the selected "RoomB_Keypad" element. It includes sections for Debug Data, Behavior, and Attributes. The Debug Data section shows information like Entity Id and Script Instance Data. The Behavior section has toggles for Visible and Collidable, and settings for Motion, Animation, Loop, Play on Start, Speed, and Enable client smoothing. The Attributes section displays Position, Rotation, Scale, and Tint Color values.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual element is the keypad in the central scene area. The left panel serves as a navigation tool, allowing the user to select different elements within the scene. The right panel provides detailed property settings for the selected element. There are no arrows or lines connecting elements, but the layout suggests a logical flow from selection to property editing.
