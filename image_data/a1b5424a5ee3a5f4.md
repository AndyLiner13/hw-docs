## Content

### Overview
This image shows a user interface element with two settings options displayed against a dark background. The layout includes a dropdown menu and a toggle switch.

### Key Elements
- **Preview device**: Located at the top-left corner, this is a label indicating a setting related to the device being previewed. It has no accompanying text or icon.
- **Dropdown menu**: Positioned to the right of the "Preview device" label, it contains the word "None" and a downward-facing arrow, suggesting a selection can be made from a list.
- **UI safe zone overlay**: Below the dropdown menu, this is another label indicating a setting related to the user interface's safe zone. To its right is a toggle switch that is currently off, indicated by the white square on the left side of the switch.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual elements are the labels and the toggle switch. The dropdown menu is less prominent but still noticeable due to its placement next to the "Preview device" label. There are no arrows or lines connecting elements, so the reading order is linear from left to right.
