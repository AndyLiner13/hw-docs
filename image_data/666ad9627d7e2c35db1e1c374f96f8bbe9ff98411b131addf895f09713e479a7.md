## Content

### Overview
The image depicts a virtual environment with a user interface overlaying a 3D scene. The interface consists of multiple panels displaying code-like content and interconnected with lines, suggesting a programming or scripting context within a game development tool.

### Key Elements
- **Large Panel (Left)**: Located on the left side, this panel contains a series of code blocks with purple and blue highlights. The text includes keywords like "player," "spawn," and "update." The panel has a dark background with light text.
- **Smaller Panels (Right)**: Two smaller panels are positioned to the right of the large panel. These panels appear to be interactive, with some elements highlighted in green and others in white. They seem to represent different functions or settings related to the larger panel.
- **Lines/Connections**: Black lines connect the panels, indicating a flow or sequence of operations.
- **3D Scene**: Below the interface, a simple 3D environment is visible. It includes a transparent blue cube and a green rectangular object, both placed on a grid floor. A small purple cube is also present near the green object.
- **Background**: The background is a gradient sky with a light blue hue, giving the impression of an open-world environment.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
- **Most Prominent Element**: The large panel on the left.
- **Arrows/Connections**: The black lines connecting the panels suggest a flow or sequence of operations.
- **Spatial Relationships**: The panels are arranged horizontally, with the smaller panels to the right of the larger one. The 3D objects are positioned below the interface, indicating a separation between the UI and the game world.
