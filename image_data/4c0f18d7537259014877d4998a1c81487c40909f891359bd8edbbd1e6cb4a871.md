The foreground includes a circular track with barriers, suggesting a racing or combat scenario. Various UI elements are visible around the arena.

### Key Elements

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual element is the **arena label**, which draws attention due to its size and glowing effect. The **track** is secondary but essential as it defines the area of activity. The **background landscape** provides context and setting, while the **UI elements** offer functional information. There are no explicit arrows or lines connecting elements, but the layout suggests a natural reading order moving from the left UI panels to the central arena.
