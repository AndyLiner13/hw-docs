## Content

### Overview
This image depicts a user interface from a character builder tool, specifically within the "Voice and Speech" section. The layout includes a sidebar menu, a central content area displaying voice options, and a right panel for voice testing and properties adjustment.

### Key Elements
- **Sidebar Menu**: Located on the left side, it contains navigation items such as "Character Description," "Instructions," "Voice and Speech," and "Avatar." The "Voice and Speech" option is highlighted, indicating the current active section.
- **Central Content Area**: This area is divided into two sections. The upper part displays a "Voice library" heading with a search bar and dropdown filters labeled "All Tags" and "Any Gender." Below this, a blue-highlighted section indicates a selected voice named "Plain," described as "Plain-spoken, everyday barista," with a checkmark and "Assigned" label next to it. Below this, a list of "Premade voices" is shown, each with a play icon, a name, a brief description, and a gender indicator.
- **Right Panel**: This section includes a "Voice test phrase" input field with a play button and a timer showing "0:02." Below this, there are "Properties" settings for "Speed" and "Pitch," each with a slider set at "100." At the bottom right, there is a "Save" button.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual element is the selected "Plain" voice, which is highlighted in blue. The flow moves from the sidebar menu to the central content area, focusing on the voice selection process, and then to the right panel for testing and property adjustments. There are no arrows or lines connecting elements, but the layout suggests a linear progression through the sections.
