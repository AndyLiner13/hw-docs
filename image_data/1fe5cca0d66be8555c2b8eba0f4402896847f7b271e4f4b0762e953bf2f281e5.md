## Content

### Overview
This image depicts a flowchart with various states and transitions represented by boxes and arrows. The flowchart illustrates a process involving multiple stages labeled as "NotReady," "Unloaded," "Loading," "Paused," "Loaded," "Active," "Unloading," and "Disposed." Arrows indicate the progression and conditions under which transitions occur.

### Key Elements
- **NotReady**: A light purple box at the top with the label "NotReady." It has a single arrow pointing downward labeled "download asset info."
- **Unloaded**: A light purple box below "NotReady" with the label "Unloaded." An arrow points downward to "Loading."
- **Loading**: A light purple box with the label "Loading." Arrows point from "NotReady" and "Unloaded" to "Loading."
- **Paused**: A yellow box below "Loading" with the label "Paused." Arrows point from "Loading" to "Paused."
- **Loaded**: A light purple box below "Loading" with the label "Loaded." Arrows point from "Loading" to "Loaded."
- **Active**: A light green box below "Loaded" with the label "Active." Arrows point from "Loaded" to "Active."
- **Unloading**: A light purple box below "Active" with the label "Unloading." Arrows point from "Active" and "Loaded" to "Unloading."
- **Disposed**: A pink box at the bottom with the label "Disposed." Arrows point from "Unloading" and "Active" to "Disposed."

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual element is the sequence of states moving from "NotReady" through "Unloaded," "Loading," "Paused," "Loaded," "Active," "Unloading," and finally to "Disposed." Arrows indicate the direction of transitions, with some loops indicating conditions that can cause cycles within certain states. The flowchart uses dotted lines for some transitions, suggesting optional paths or conditions.
