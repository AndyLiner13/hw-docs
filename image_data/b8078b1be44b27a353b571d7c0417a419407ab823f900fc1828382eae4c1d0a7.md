## Content

### Overview
This image depicts a user interface of a profiling tool, likely for analyzing performance data of a software application. The layout includes a navigation pane on the left, a timeline visualization in the center, and a table of performance metrics at the bottom.

### Key Elements
- **Navigation Pane (Left)**:
  - **Visual description**: A vertical sidebar with a dark theme.
  - **Location**: Left side of the image.
  - **Contents**: Contains options such as "Open trace file," "Record new trace," "Show timeline," "Download," "Query (SQL)," "Viz," "Metrics," "Info and stats," "Switch to legacy UI," "Convert to .json," "Convert to .sysrace," "Open Android example," and "Open Chrome example."
  - **Visual styling**: Dark background with white text and icons.

- **Timeline Visualization (Center)**:
  - **Visual description**: A horizontal timeline with colored bars representing different events or processes over time.
  - **Location**: Center of the image.
  - **Contents**: The timeline spans from 00:00:00 to 00:00:09, with timestamps marked every second.
  - **Visual styling**: White background with colored bars, some with labels indicating specific events.

- **Tree View (Center)**:
  - **Visual description**: A hierarchical tree view showing trace events and kernel threads.
  - **Location**: Center of the image, above the timeline.
  - **Contents**: Includes nodes labeled "Trace Events," "Misc Global Tracks," and "Kernel threads," with expandable/collapsible sections.
  - **Visual styling**: Dark background with white text and checkboxes next to each node.

- **Performance Table (Bottom)**:
  - **Visual description**: A table listing performance metrics.
  - **Location**: Bottom of the image.
  - **Contents**: Columns include "Name," "Wall duration (ms)," "Avg Wall duration (ms)," and "Occurrences." Rows show various functions and their respective durations and occurrences.
  - **Visual styling**: Light gray background with black text, bordered by a thin line.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
- **Most prominent visually**: The timeline visualization in the center.
- **Arrows/lines/connectors**: None explicitly shown.
- **Spatial relationships**: The timeline is below the tree view, and the performance table is at the bottom. The tree view branches out from the timeline, suggesting a relationship between the timeline events and the tree nodes.
