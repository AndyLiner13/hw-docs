## Content

### Overview
This image displays a user interface snippet that appears to be part of a visual programming environment or a game development tool. It shows conditional logic blocks with text inputs and outputs. The blocks are arranged vertically, indicating a sequence of actions or events.

### Key Elements
- **Block 1**: Located at the top, it has a green header with the text "> when player consume succeeds on item". Inside the block, there is a text input field labeled "ok" and a variable reference "t2".
- **Block 2**: Below Block 1, it has a blue header with the text "> when player consume fails on item". Similar to Block 1, it contains a text input field labeled "not ok" and a variable reference "t2".

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The blocks are arranged in a vertical sequence, suggesting a step-by-step process. There are no arrows or lines connecting the blocks, implying that the sequence is linear but not necessarily sequential in terms of execution order within the larger context of the program.
