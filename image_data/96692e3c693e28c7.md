## Content

### Overview
This image depicts a 3D modeling software interface, specifically a scene view within a game development environment. The central area shows a 3D scene with a skybox background, a grid floor, and several 3D models placed within the scene. The left side displays a hierarchical list of objects, while the right side shows properties for selected objects.

### Key Elements
- **Scene View**: Central area showing a 3D scene with a blue sky gradient, a white sphere floating above a platform, and a grid floor. The platform has red cubes arranged on it.
- **Hierarchy Panel**: Left side, displaying a tree-like structure of objects in the scene. Examples include "Sphere," "[EntityGroup]," "[3D Model] Cube," "[3D Model] Cylinder.012," and "Trigger."
- **Properties Panel**: Right side, currently empty as no object is selected. It prompts users to "Select an object to view its properties."
- **Navigation Controls**: Top bar includes buttons for play, step forward, step backward, and other scene navigation options.
- **View Settings**: Options for local view, centering, and zoom level adjustments are located at the top.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual element is the 3D scene in the center. The hierarchy panel on the left provides context for the objects displayed in the scene. The properties panel on the right is designed to display information about the selected object but is currently inactive. Navigation controls are positioned at the top for easy access during scene manipulation.
