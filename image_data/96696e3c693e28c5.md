## Content

### Overview
This image depicts a 3D modeling environment interface, likely from a game development tool. The central area shows a 3D scene with a sky background, a floating white sphere, and some 3D objects resembling containers or crates arranged on a flat surface. The left side displays a hierarchy of objects, while the right side shows properties for selected objects.

### Key Elements
- **Central Scene**: A large blue sky dominates the background, transitioning to lighter shades towards the horizon. A white sphere is floating near the center-right of the screen.
- **3D Objects**: Several red and purple rectangular objects are stacked on a flat, grid-like surface. These appear to be containers or crates.
- **Hierarchy Panel**: Located on the left, it lists objects such as "SpawnPoint," "Sphere," "[Sublevel]," and "[EntityGroup]" with icons indicating their nature.
- **Properties Panel**: On the right, it prompts users to "Select an object to view its properties." It has a dark background with a small icon resembling a cube.
- **Grid Floor**: A light gray grid covers the floor, suggesting a workspace for 3D modeling.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual is the central scene with the floating sphere. The 3D objects are arranged on the grid floor, and the hierarchy panel on the left lists the objects' names and types. The properties panel on the right is inactive, awaiting user interaction.
