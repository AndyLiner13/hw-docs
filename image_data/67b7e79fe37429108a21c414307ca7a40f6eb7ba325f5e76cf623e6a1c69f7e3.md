## Content

### Overview
The image depicts a user interface from a 3D modeling or game development software. The central area shows a 3D view with a cube model, while the right side displays various properties and settings related to the cube. The interface includes a large "Hello World" text in the middle, suggesting a tutorial or example scene.

### Key Elements
- **Central Scene**: A 3D view showing a cube model with a grid floor. The cube has a small blue dot at its center, likely indicating the pivot point, and red and green arrows pointing up and to the right, representing the axes.
- **Text**: "Hello World" prominently displayed in the middle of the screen.
- **Properties Panel**: Located on the right side, containing several sections such as "Behavior," "Attributes," and "GameplayTags." It shows properties like visibility, collision settings, and position, rotation, scale values.
- **Cube Model**: A simple white cube in the 3D view, positioned slightly above the grid plane.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
- **Most Prominent Element**: The "Hello World" text.
- **Arrows**: Red and green arrows in the 3D view indicate the axes of the cube.
- **Panel Layout**: The properties panel is divided into sections with headings like "Behavior," "Attributes," and "GameplayTags."
