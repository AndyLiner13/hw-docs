## Content

### Overview
This image depicts a settings interface titled "Script Settings." It is a modal window with a dark theme, featuring a sidebar menu on the left and a content area on the right. The content area is divided into sections labeled "API," "horizon/experimental," "horizon/testing," etc., with toggle switches next to each API name.

### Key Elements
- **Sidebar Menu**: Located on the left side, with options "Script editing," "API," and "Console." The "API" option is highlighted with a blue vertical line indicating selection.
- **Content Area**: On the right, under the "API" heading, a list of APIs is displayed vertically. Each API has a toggle switch to the right.
    - **API List Items**: 
        - horizon/experimental
        - horizon/testing
        - horizon/2p
        - horizon/analytics
        - horizon/performance
        - horizon/navmesh

    - **Toggle Switches**: Positioned to the right of each API item, these are currently off except for "horizon/test_bridge," which is toggled on.
- **Buttons**: At the bottom of the content area, there are two buttons labeled "Cancel" and "Apply."

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual element is the "API" section, as indicated by the blue highlight. The APIs are listed vertically, and the toggle switches are aligned to the right. The "Apply" button is visually distinct due to its blue color, suggesting it is the primary action to confirm changes. The "Cancel" button is less prominent but still noticeable.
