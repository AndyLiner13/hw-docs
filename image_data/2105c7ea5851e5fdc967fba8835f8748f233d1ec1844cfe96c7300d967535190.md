## Content

### Overview
This image depicts a 3D modeling software interface, specifically showing a scene preview within a viewport. The interface includes a hierarchy panel on the left, a properties panel on the right, and a central viewport displaying a skydome environment. The viewport contains a landscape with a desert-like terrain and a colorful sky.

### Key Elements
- **Hierarchy Panel**: Located on the left side, it displays a tree structure with nodes labeled "SpawnPoint," "WorldInit," "Leaderboard-TextLabel," "Quest-TextLabel," "Common," and "z Unused." The node "[Environment] Example Skydome" is highlighted in blue.
- **Viewport**: Positioned centrally, it shows a 3D environment with a desert landscape featuring rock formations and a vibrant sky with hues of pink, purple, and blue. The ground is a grid pattern, suggesting a virtual workspace.
- **Properties Panel**: On the right, it contains various settings related to the environment, such as "Active," "Custom Skydome," "Shadow Intensity," "Reflection Intensity," "Texture Rotation," "Exposure," "Custom Light Intensity," "Custom Fog Color," "Fog Density," "Show Grid," and "VOIP Settings." Some options have checkboxes next to them, indicating interactive elements.
- **Scene Controls**: At the top of the viewport, there are controls for local view orientation ("Local," "Center"), zoom level ("Relative"), and camera settings ("1.0").
- **Scene Navigation**: Below the viewport, there are navigation tools including "Add New," "All Assets," "My Folders," and a search bar labeled "Search skydomes."

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual element is the central viewport, which serves as the focal point of the interface. The hierarchy panel on the left provides context for the elements displayed in the viewport. The properties panel on the right offers detailed settings for the environment being viewed. The scene controls at the top provide interactive tools for manipulating the view within the viewport.
