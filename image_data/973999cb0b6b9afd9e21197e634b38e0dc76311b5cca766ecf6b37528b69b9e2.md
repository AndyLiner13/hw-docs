## Content

### Overview
This image displays a performance metrics overlay on a game interface. It includes real-time data on FPS, CPU usage, GPU usage, and wait times for GPU operations. The overlay has a dark theme with a semi-transparent background that allows the game's environment to be partially visible behind it.

### Key Elements
- **FPS Section**: Located at the top left, showing "60 current" with a target of "72" and a maximum of "60". A red dot indicates the current value.
- **CPU Usage Section**: Below the FPS section, displaying "16.8 avg (0.5s)" with a target of "13.9" and a maximum of "20.58". A red dot marks the average value.
- **GPU Usage Section**: Positioned below the CPU section, showing "9.7 avg (0.5s)" with a target of "13.9" and a maximum of "10.03". Another red dot highlights the average.
- **Wait for GPU Section**: At the bottom, indicating "0.4 avg (0.5s)" with a target of "1.0" and a maximum of "1.48". A red dot marks the average.
- **Graphs**: Each metric has a corresponding graph above its respective section, showing fluctuations over time.
- **Inspect Button**: Located at the bottom right, labeled "Inspect".

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The overlay is designed to be easily readable against the game's background. The graphs provide a visual representation of the data trends, while the red dots draw attention to the current values. The layout is structured to prioritize the most critical information first, with the FPS being the most prominent due to its central placement and larger font size.
