### Overview
The image depicts a custom user interface (UI) design for a game or simulation environment. It includes a health bar system labeled as "Station #8 Health Bar," a skeleton character, and various UI elements such as progress bars and text labels.

### Key Elements
- **Health Bar Label**: Located at the top-left, within a blue rectangular box with rounded corners. Contains the text "> STATION #8 HEALTH BAR <" in white and yellow.
- **Progress Bars**: Two horizontal progress bars are visible. One is green and located near the skeleton character, labeled "SKELETON." The other is a smaller blue progress bar situated below the health bar label.
- **Text Labels**: Two labels indicating health percentages are present on the floor tiles. One reads "0% HP" and the other "33% HP."
- **Title Text**: A large, bold text "Custom UI 1.0" is displayed prominently in the center, with a gradient background transitioning from orange to pink.
- **Examples Text**: Below the title, a black rectangular box contains the word "Examples" in white text.
- **Skeleton Character**: Positioned on the right side of the image, standing in a fighting stance. The skeleton is depicted in a light gray color with a sword and shield.
- **Background**: The background consists of a tiled wall with a yellowish hue and gray grout lines.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
- **Most Prominent Element**: The title "Custom UI 1.0" is the most visually prominent due to its size and central placement.
- **Arrows/Connections**: There are no explicit arrows or connections between elements.
- **Spatial Relationships**: The health bar label is positioned at the top-left, the progress bars are below it, and the skeleton character is on the right. The health percentage labels are on the floor tiles, and the title text is centered above them.
