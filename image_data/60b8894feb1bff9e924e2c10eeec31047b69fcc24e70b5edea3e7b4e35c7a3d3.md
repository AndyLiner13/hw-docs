## Content

### Overview
This image depicts a user interface element showing a scale with numerical values for X, Y, and Z axes. The layout is simple and linear, with the scale label at the top and the numerical values aligned horizontally below it.

### Key Elements
- **Scale Label**: Located at the top-left corner, the label reads "Scale".
- **X Value**: Positioned to the right of the scale label, the value is "50". It is displayed in white text against a dark background.
- **Y Value**: Situated next to the X value, the Y value is "0.05". It also has white text on a dark background.
- **Z Value**: Positioned to the right of the Y value, the Z value is "50". Similar to the others, it is white text on a dark background.
- **Background**: The entire interface has a dark background, likely black or very dark gray.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The visual hierarchy is straightforward, with the scale label being the most prominent element due to its placement at the top. The numerical values follow in a horizontal line beneath the label, with no connecting lines or arrows indicating a specific reading order. The elements are aligned horizontally and are evenly spaced.
