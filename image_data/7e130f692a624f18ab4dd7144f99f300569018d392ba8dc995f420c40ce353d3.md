## Content

### Overview
The image displays a user interface for managing A/B testing scenarios, specifically for thumbnail image tests. It includes a table listing various test entries with columns for Name, Target, Type, Status, Winner, Start date, and Completion date. There are also filters at the top and a search bar for finding specific tests.

### Key Elements

- **Description**: Below the header, there's a brief explanation about the purpose of A/B testing.
- **Filters**: Three dropdown menus labeled "All worlds," "All statuses," and "This year" allow users to filter the tests.
- **Search Bar**: Positioned below the filters, it has a placeholder text "Search tests..." indicating its purpose.
- **Table**: Contains rows of test information:
  - **Name**: "Legacy update," "New year update," "Spring cover test," "Holiday special test."

### Visual Flow / Relationships

- The layout follows a grid structure with clear separation between the header, filters, search bar, and the main content area.
