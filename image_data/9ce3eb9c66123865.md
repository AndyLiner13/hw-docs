## Content

### Overview
The image depicts a small island with rugged, rocky terrain surrounded by water. A small blue house with a wooden deck is situated on the sandy part of the island near the waterline. The sky is clear and blue, suggesting a calm day.

### Key Elements
- **Rocky Terrain**: Large, jagged rocks form the majority of the island. They are light gray with some darker patches, giving them a textured appearance.
- **Sand**: A strip of light brown sand runs along the base of the rocks and extends towards the water.
- **Water**: The surrounding area is filled with calm blue water that reflects the sky.
- **Blue House**: A small, rectangular building with a dark blue exterior and a lighter blue roof sits on a wooden deck supported by white stilts. The house has a window on one side and an open door on the other.
- **Mouse Cursor**: A white arrow cursor is visible near the bottom right of the image, indicating interaction with the image.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual element is the rocky terrain, which forms the backdrop of the scene. The blue house is secondary but clearly defined against the natural landscape. The sand strip acts as a transition between the rocks and the water. The calm water surrounds the entire island, creating a serene environment. There are no arrows or lines connecting elements, and the reading order is implied by the natural layout of the island.
