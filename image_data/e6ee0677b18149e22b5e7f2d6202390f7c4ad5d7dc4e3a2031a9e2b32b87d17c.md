## Content

### Overview
This image depicts a 3D modeling software interface, specifically showing a scene view with a cube object centered in the workspace. The interface includes a hierarchy panel on the left, a properties panel on the right, and a central workspace area displaying a blue sky gradient background with a grid floor.

### Key Elements
- **Hierarchy Panel**: Located on the left side, it lists various objects in the scene, such as "Sphere," "Script," "[Environment]," and others. The "Cube" object is highlighted in blue, indicating selection.
- **Scene Workspace**: Occupies the central area, featuring a blue sky gradient background with a tiled floor grid. A white cube is centered in the workspace.
- **Properties Panel**: Positioned on the right, it displays properties related to the selected "Cube" object, including visibility, light & shadow settings, collision layer, attributes like position, rotation, scale, texture, material roughness, color, game tags, physics settings, and more.
- **Navigation Controls**: At the top of the interface, there are navigation controls for play, pause, and other functions.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual element is the white cube in the center of the workspace. The hierarchy panel on the left and the properties panel on the right provide contextual information about the selected object. The workspace serves as the main area for viewing and manipulating the 3D model.
