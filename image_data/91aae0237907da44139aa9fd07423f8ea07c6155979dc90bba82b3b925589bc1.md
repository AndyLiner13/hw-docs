### Overview
The image depicts a user interface within a game development environment, specifically showing a "Leaderboards" window. The window is part of a larger interface that includes a scene preview in the center and various toolbars at the top and sides. The scene preview shows a dark, eerie environment with a tree and a mausoleum-like structure.

### Key Elements
