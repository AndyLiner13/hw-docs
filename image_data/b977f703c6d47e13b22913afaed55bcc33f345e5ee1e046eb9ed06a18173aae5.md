Primitive assets: Use shapes, templates and a library of assets in Horizon Worlds. If you've created in Horizon before, you've used this method. Custom model import: Import all your worlds' assets from your favorite 3D creation tool. You won't be able to use assets previously created in Horizon Worlds."
