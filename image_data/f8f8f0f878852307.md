## Content

### Overview
This image depicts a user interface element within a software application, specifically a settings menu related to nametags. The interface includes a search bar, a list of script options, and a button labeled "Attach script."

### Key Elements
- **Search Bar**: Located at the top of the interface, it has a blue outline and contains a magnifying glass icon. The placeholder text inside the search bar reads "> CrystalBall:CrystalBall".
- **List of Scripts**: Below the search bar, there are two items listed:
  - **CrystalBall:CrystalBall**: This item is highlighted with a darker background compared to the others, indicating it might be selected or hovered over.
  - **New NPC conversation script**: This item is partially visible and appears as a clickable option.
  - **New script**: This item is also partially visible and appears as another clickable option.
- **Attach Script Button**: Positioned above the search bar, it is a blue button with white text that says "Attach script".
- **Menu Header**: At the very top, the header reads "Nametag settings".

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual element is the search bar, which is centrally located and draws attention due to its active state. The list of scripts is arranged vertically beneath the search bar, with the "CrystalBall:CrystalBall" item being the most visually distinct due to its darker background. The "Attach script" button is positioned above the search bar, serving as a call-to-action. The overall layout suggests a linear reading order moving from the top-down.
