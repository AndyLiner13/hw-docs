## Content

### Overview
This image depicts a visual representation of a sequence of events or conditions related to player actions within a game or application. The layout resembles a flowchart or a visual scripting interface, with blocks representing different conditions and actions.

### Key Elements
- **When Block**: Located at the top left, this block has a green rounded rectangle with a white icon inside, indicating a condition or event trigger. The text reads: `when player purchase succeeds on item`.
- **Debug Print Block**: Adjacent to the When block, this block has a dark blue rounded rectangle with a white icon inside, labeled as `Debug Print`. The text reads: `purchase succeeds`.
- **When Block**: Below the first When block, another block with similar styling triggers when a player's purchase fails. The text reads: `when player purchase fails on item`.
- **Debug Print Block**: Next to the second When block, this block displays `purchase fails`.
- **When Block**: Further down, another When block is shown, indicating an action when trying to consume an item from inventory. The text reads: `when player try to consume item from inventory`.
- **Debug Print Block**: Following the third When block, this block shows `try consume`.
- **Consume Block**: This block is labeled `consume` and contains a placeholder ID (`consumablenaoutouse_be64b1af`) and specifies that it's for a player. The text reads: `consume consumablenaoutouse_be64b1af for player`.
- **When Block**: Below the Consume block, another When block indicates success in consuming an item. The text reads: `when player consume succeeds on item`.
- **Debug Print Block**: Next to the fourth When block, this block shows `consume succed`.
- **Send Block**: This block is labeled `send` and includes a dropdown menu with the text `restoreHealth`, followed by a player icon and the word `with`. The text reads: `send restoreHealth to player with player parameters`.
- **When Block**: At the bottom, another When block triggers when the consumption fails. The text reads: `when player consume fails on item`.
- **Debug Print Block**: Finally, this block displays `consume fail`.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The visual flow is linear, moving from top to bottom and left to right. Each When block introduces a new condition, followed by a Debug Print block that outputs the result of that condition. The sequence is structured to show a series of possible outcomes based on player actions.
