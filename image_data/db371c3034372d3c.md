## Content

### Overview
The image depicts a scene from a 3D modeling software interface. It shows a workspace with two objects: a bottle and a rectangular frame. The right side of the image displays a properties panel.

### Key Elements
- **Bottle**: A 3D model resembling a bottle with a red cap, located on the left side of the workspace. It has a gradient color transitioning from orange at the bottom to a darker shade towards the top.
- **Rectangular Frame**: Positioned centrally in the workspace, it appears to be a 3D frame with a transparent front face and a solid back. It has a yellow border and a small icon resembling a camera lens in the center.
- **Workspace**: The area beneath the objects is a grid, suggesting a 3D modeling environment.
- **Properties Panel**: On the right side, it contains a title labeled "Properties" and a prompt "Select an object to view its properties."

### Visual Flow / Relationships
- **Most Prominent Element**: The rectangular frame due to its central placement and distinct features.
- **Arrows/Connectors**: None visible.
- **Spatial Relationships**: The bottle is to the left, the frame is centered, and the properties panel is on the far right.
