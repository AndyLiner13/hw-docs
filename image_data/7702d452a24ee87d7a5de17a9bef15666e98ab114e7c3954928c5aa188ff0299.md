   - **Visual styling**: Blue for keywords (`this`, `connectCodeBlockEvent`, `CodeBlockEvents`, `OnPlayerEnterTrigger`, `playerEnterTrigger`), green for class names (`this.entity`), and orange for the method name (`bind`).

2. **Method `start()`**
   - **Visual description**: Another method definition.
   - **Location**: Below `preStart()`.
