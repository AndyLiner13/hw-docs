## Content

### Overview
The image displays a split-screen view of a 3D modeling software interface showing a character model on a skateboard. The left side shows the model without any transformation applied, while the right side shows the model after a transformation has been applied. The interface includes various toolbars at the top with options for local and center transformations, as well as a pivot point selection feature.

### Key Elements
#### Left Side
- **Visual description**: A 3D model of a cartoonish bird wearing sunglasses, standing on a skateboard.
- **Location**: Center of the left panel.
- **Contents**: The bird is orange with a round head, large feet, and a small beak. It is wearing dark sunglasses.
- **Visual styling**: The background is a gradient blue sky with a light gray ground plane.

#### Right Side
- **Visual description**: The same 3D model of the bird on a skateboard, but with additional visual elements indicating transformations.
- **Location**: Center of the right panel.
- **Contents**: The bird is still orange with sunglasses, standing on a skateboard. There are green and red arrows indicating axes of rotation, and a red dot marking the pivot point.
- **Visual styling**: The background remains a gradient blue sky with a light gray ground plane.

- **Location**: Below the bird on the right side.
- **Contents**: Green arrow pointing upwards, red arrow pointing to the right, and a red dot marking the pivot point.
- **Visual styling**: Green and red arrows with a white outline.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
- **Most prominent visually**: The 3D model of the bird on the skateboard.
- **Arrows and dots**: Indicate the axes of rotation and the pivot point, guiding the viewer's attention to the transformation applied to the model.
- **Spatial relationships**: The left side shows the original model, while the right side shows the model after applying transformations indicated by the axes and pivot point.
