## Content

### Overview
This image depicts a 3D modeling environment interface, likely from a game development tool such as Unity. The central area displays a 3D scene with a grid floor and walls labeled "Lobby." The left sidebar shows a hierarchical list of objects within the scene, while the right sidebar contains properties for selected objects. The top bar includes various tools and settings typical of a 3D modeling software.

### Key Elements
- **Central Scene**: A 3D view showing a room labeled "Lobby" with a grid floor and walls. The walls are orange with a grid pattern, and the floor is gray with a grid overlay.
- **Left Sidebar**: Contains a hierarchical list of objects named "Lobby Spawn Point," "PlayerManager," "GameManager," "GameUtils," "StartGameTrigger," "EndGameTrigger," "Start Match Trigger," "End Game Trigger," "Game Manager," "Player Manager," "Environment," "BoxCollider," and "Match Spawn Point."
- **Right Sidebar**: Displays a message "Select an object to view its properties" and a small icon resembling a cube.
- **Top Bar**: Includes various tools and settings such as "Local," "Center," "Relative," and others, along with a search bar at the top left.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual element is the central 3D scene. The left sidebar is secondary but essential for navigation through the project's objects. The right sidebar is less prominent but serves as a property viewer. The top bar provides tools for manipulating the scene.
