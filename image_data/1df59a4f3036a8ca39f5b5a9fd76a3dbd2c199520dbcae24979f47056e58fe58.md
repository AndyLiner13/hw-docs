### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual element is the "Scripts" header, which draws attention due to its larger font size and central placement. The search bar and related interactive elements are arranged horizontally beneath the header. The settings gear icon and ellipsis menu are positioned to the right, suggesting they are secondary actions related to the primary "Scripts" functionality. The red arrow points towards the settings gear icon, indicating a possible interaction or focus point.
