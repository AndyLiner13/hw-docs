### Overview
This image depicts a flowchart-style diagram illustrating transitions between states related to player interaction with an object. The chart includes decision points and actions that determine the state of the object based on player actions.

### Key Elements
- **Not Held**: A purple oval at the top, indicating the initial state where the object is not held by the player.
- **player grabs with a hand**: A light blue rectangle below "Not Held," describing the action of grabbing the object with one hand.
- **Ownership transfer**: A yellow highlight underlines the phrase "Ownership transfer," suggesting a specific focus on this action.
- **OnGrabStart**: A green rectangle below the blue rectangle, labeled as the event triggered when the grab starts.
- **Held with 1 hand**: A purple oval below the "Not Held" state, indicating the state where the object is held with one hand.
- **player grabs with second hand**: A light blue rectangle below the "Held with 1 hand" state, describing the action of grabbing the object with the second hand.
- **OnMultiGrabStart**: A green rectangle below the blue rectangle, labeled as the event triggered when multiple hands start grabbing.
- **Held with 2 hands**: A purple oval below the "Held with 1 hand" state, indicating the state where the object is held with both hands.
- **player releases hand or forceReleasecalled**: A light blue rectangle below the "Held with 1 hand" state, describing the action of releasing the hand or calling a force release.
- **OnGrabEnd**: A green rectangle below the blue rectangle, labeled as the event triggered when the grab ends.
- **forceReleasecalled**: A light blue rectangle below the "Held with 1 hand" state, describing the action of calling a force release.
- **OnMultiGrabEnd**: A green rectangle below the blue rectangle, labeled as the event triggered when multiple hands end grabbing.
- **OnGrabEnd**: A green rectangle below the blue rectangle, labeled as the event triggered when the grab ends.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The flowchart has a clear hierarchical structure with arrows connecting the states and actions. The most prominent visual element is the "Not Held" state at the top, which branches out into different paths depending on the player's actions. Arrows indicate the sequence of events and transitions between states. The flowchart uses a top-down approach, starting from the initial state and moving through various scenarios until reaching the final state.
