### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual element is the message box itself, which contains the message text and the two buttons. The Close button is positioned to the left and below the message text, while the Track your report button is positioned to the right and below the message text. There are no arrows or lines connecting the elements, but the layout suggests a sequential reading order starting from the message text and moving towards the buttons.
