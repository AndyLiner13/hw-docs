## Content

### Overview
This image depicts a user interface from a development environment, likely related to game development or 3D modeling, showing performance metrics and asset management. The layout includes a sidebar, a central performance graph, and a properties panel on the right.

### Key Elements
- **Sidebar (Left Panel)**: Contains a list of objects or entities labeled as "SpawnPoint," "SmoothCylinder," "Cube," and others.
- **Performance Graph (Center)**: A large area displaying performance metrics over time, segmented into categories like "GPU," "Physics," "Scripting," "Audio," "Avatar," "Calls," and "Animation." Each category has a line graph representing performance data.
- **Properties Panel (Right Panel)**: Divided into two tabs: "Assets" and "Memory." The "Assets" tab lists assets with columns for "NAME," "USED BY," "ASSET TYPE," and "MEMORY STATUS." The "Memory" tab is currently active but empty.
- **Search Bar**: Located at the top of the properties panel, allowing users to search through assets.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual elements are the performance graphs in the center, which guide the viewer's attention horizontally across the timeline. The sidebar on the left provides context for the assets being analyzed. The properties panel on the right offers detailed information about the assets, with the "Assets" tab currently in focus.
