## Content

### Overview
This image depicts a user interface element within a software application, likely related to 3D modeling or asset management. The interface includes a search bar, a list of textures, and various attributes settings.

### Key Elements
- **Search Bar**: Located at the bottom of the interface, it has a blue outline and contains the text "> scifi". It is interactive, suggesting that users can type into it to search for specific textures.
- **Texture List**: Below the search bar, there is a list displaying a single item labeled "SciFi Generator Texture". This item has a small icon resembling a wave pattern next to its name.
- **Attributes Panel**: Positioned on the right side of the screen, this panel displays various attributes such as Position, Rotation, Scale, Tint Strength, and Brightness. Each attribute has numerical values next to them, indicating the current settings.
- **Enable Client Smoothing Toggle**: At the very top-right corner, there is a toggle switch labeled "Enable client smoothing".

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual element is the search bar, as it is the focal point for interaction. The texture list is secondary but important for content selection. The attributes panel provides contextual information about the selected texture. The layout follows a typical UI design with clear separation between input fields, lists, and settings.
