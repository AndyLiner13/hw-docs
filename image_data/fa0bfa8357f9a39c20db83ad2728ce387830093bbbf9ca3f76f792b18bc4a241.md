## Content

### Overview
This image displays a user interface (UI) element from a software application, specifically a settings or configuration panel. The UI has a dark theme with a grid background, and it includes various controls and options related to visual and interaction settings.

### Key Elements
- **Top Panel**: 
  - **Header**: "CustomUI" at the top left, with a lock icon and a close ("X") button on the right.
  - **Tabs**: Three tabs labeled "Visual & Interaction," "Web and Mobile," and "Behavior."
  - **Settings**: Options include "Raycast," "Raycast distance," "Mipmap," and "Mipmap bias." Each setting has a toggle switch next to it.
  - **Input Fields**: Text input fields for "Raycast distance" and "Mipmap bias."

- **Bottom Panel**: 
  - **Attached Script**: A dropdown menu labeled "Uldemo2:Uldemo2" with a minus sign indicating the ability to remove the script.
  - **Script Parameters**: Three parameters labeled "texture," "trigger," and "ball," each with a minus sign to remove them.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual elements are the settings and attached script panels. The settings panel is divided into sections with clear labels and toggles. The attached script panel is simpler, with a dropdown and parameter inputs. There are no arrows or lines connecting elements, but the layout suggests a linear reading order moving from top to bottom.
