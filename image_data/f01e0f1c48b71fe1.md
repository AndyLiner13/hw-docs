### Overview
This image depicts a user interface element consisting of a play button icon within a red square, alongside a smaller gray square and a vertical ellipsis menu icon.

### Key Elements
- **Play Button Icon**: A red square containing a white play icon (a right-pointing triangle).
- **Gray Square**: Located to the right of the play button, it is a small, solid gray square.
- **Ellipsis Menu Icon**: Positioned further to the right, it consists of three vertically aligned dots.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The play button icon is the most prominent element due to its larger size and distinct color. The gray square and ellipsis menu icon are secondary elements, placed to the right of the play button. There are no connecting lines or arrows, so the relationship is purely spatial.
