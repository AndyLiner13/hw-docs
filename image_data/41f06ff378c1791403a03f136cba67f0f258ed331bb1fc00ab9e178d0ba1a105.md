## Content

### Overview
The image displays a help menu for a software application named "Perfetto." It provides keyboard shortcuts and mouse controls for navigating and interacting with the application. The layout is structured into sections for navigation, Dvorak keyboard mapping, mouse controls, SQL query execution, and miscellaneous commands.

### Key Elements
- **Navigation Section**: Located at the top-left, contains keyboard shortcuts for zooming in/out (`w/s`) and panning left/right (`a/d`). The text is black on a white background.
- **Dvorak Navigation Section**: Below the Navigation section, similar layout but with Dvorak-specific keys (`,/o`, `a/e`). The text is also black on a white background.
- **Mouse Controls Section**: Positioned below the Dvorak section, includes actions like clicking, using the Ctrl + Scroll wheel, Click + Drag, and Shift + Click + Drag. The text is black on a white background.
- **SQL Queries Section**: Divided into two parts: "Making SQL queries from the viewer page" and "Making SQL queries from the query page." Each part has specific keyboard shortcuts for executing queries and pinning outputs. The text is black on a white background.
- **Other Section**: At the bottom, contains additional keyboard shortcuts for various functions such as scrolling, selecting slices, switching focus, marking areas, selecting all, toggling the sidebar, and showing help. The text is black on a white background.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The content is organized in a vertical list format, with each section clearly delineated. The most prominent elements are the headings ("Navigation," "Dvorak Navigation," "Mouse Controls," etc.), which are larger and bolder than the rest of the text. There are no arrows or lines connecting elements, so the flow is linear, moving from top to bottom.
