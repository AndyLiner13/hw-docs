## Content

### Overview
This image depicts a circular flowchart with three distinct sections, each labeled with a number and a brief description. The flowchart uses an infinity symbol shape to represent a continuous loop, indicating a cycle or process that repeats indefinitely.

### Key Elements
- **Visual description**: The infinity symbol is light blue with a gradient effect, transitioning from yellow to purple.
- **Location**: The infinity symbol spans horizontally across the image, with the left side being yellow and the right side purple.
- **Contents**: 
  - **Left Section**: "Cultivate" with the description "> Continued play builds affinity and confidence, making players more open to in-app purchases." The number "1" is in a yellow circle at the top-left corner.
  - **Middle Section**: A large blue arrow pointing clockwise, connecting the two ends of the infinity symbol.
  - **Right Section**: "Unlock engagement" with the description "> A successful purchase leads to more fun, deeper connection, and reasons to return." The number "3" is in a purple circle at the top-right corner.
  - **Bottom Section**: "Make a purchase" with the description "> Players spend money or earned credits on IAPs that should enhance enjoyment and progression." The number "2" is in a blue circle at the bottom-center.

- **Visual styling**: The infinity symbol has a smooth gradient transition from yellow to purple. The numbers are encased in circles of corresponding colors (yellow, purple, and blue).

### Visual Flow / Relationships
- **Most prominent visually**: The infinity symbol itself, as it forms the central structure of the flowchart.
- **Arrows/lines/connectors**: The large blue arrow connects the two ends of the infinity symbol, indicating the flow of the process.
- **Spatial relationships**: The sections are arranged in a circular manner, with the left and right sections connected by the arrow, and the bottom section positioned below the middle of the infinity symbol.
