## Content

### Overview
This image depicts a 3D modeling software interface, specifically showing a snowman model being edited. The interface includes a hierarchy panel on the left, a 3D view in the center, and a properties panel on the right. The snowman has a large spherical body, a smaller spherical head, a carrot nose, and black coal eyes. There are lock icons next to some objects in the hierarchy panel, indicating locked states.

### Key Elements
- **Hierarchy Panel**: Located on the left side, displaying a list of objects in the scene. The "Cone" object is highlighted, and lock icons are visible next to several objects.
- **3D View**: Centered, showing a close-up of the snowman's face and upper body. The snowman has a white, textured surface resembling snow, a carrot nose, and black coal eyes.
- **Properties Panel**: On the right, showing various attributes of the selected object ("Cone"). It includes fields for behavior, attributes, game tags, physics settings, and script attachments.
- **Lock Icon**: A red arrow points to a lock icon next to the "Cone" object in the hierarchy panel, indicating that the object is locked.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual is the snowman in the 3D view. The hierarchy panel on the left shows a structured list of objects, while the properties panel on the right provides detailed information about the selected object. The lock icon in the hierarchy panel is visually distinct due to its red color and arrow pointing to it.
