## Content

### Overview
The image displays two distinct visual representations of a leaf-like shape. One is a simple, flat texture representation labeled as "opaque texture," while the other is a more complex, three-dimensional model labeled as "Modeled details."

### Key Elements
1. **Opaque Texture (Top Left Corner):**
   - **Visual description:** A green rectangle divided into four smaller rectangles, each containing a red line pattern resembling veins.
   - **Location:** Top-left corner of the image.
   - **Contents:** The text "opaque texture" is written below the rectangle.
   - **Visual styling:** The rectangle has a solid green fill with no additional borders or shading. The red lines are thin and evenly spaced within each segment.

2. **Modeled Details (Center):**
   - **Visual description:** A green leaf shape with a central vein and multiple smaller veins branching out. The edges of the leaf are jagged, giving it a textured look.
   - **Location:** Center of the image.
   - **Contents:** The text "Modeled details" is written below the leaf.
   - **Visual styling:** The leaf is filled with a green color, and the central vein is marked with a red line. The edges of the leaf have a black outline, and the overall shape is slightly shaded to give a sense of depth.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
- **Most prominent visually:** The modeled details of the leaf are the most prominent due to their larger size and more intricate design.
- **Arrows, lines, connectors, or implied reading order:** There are no arrows or connectors; the image is static.
- **Spatial relationships:** The opaque texture is positioned to the top-left, while the modeled details occupy the center of the image. There is no overlap or adjacency between the two elements.

- **Margins:** There is a slight margin between the opaque texture and the modeled details.
- **Element alignment:** The opaque texture is aligned to the top-left corner, and the modeled details are centered.

### Interactive Elements Details
- **Element type and label:** None of the elements are interactive buttons, inputs, checkboxes, dropdowns, links, etc.
- **Visual state:** The elements are static and do not show any interactive states.
- **Position:** The opaque texture is in the top-left corner, and the modeled details are centered.
- **Styling details:** The opaque texture has a solid green fill with red lines, while the modeled details have a green fill with a black outline and a red central vein.

### Visual Indicators
- **Icons:** None.
- **Borders:** The opaque texture has no borders, but the modeled details have a black outline.
- **Shadows:** None.
- **Highlights/Emphasis:** The modeled details have a slight shading effect to emphasize depth.
