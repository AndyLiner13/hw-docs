## Content

### Overview
This image depicts a 3D modeling software interface, specifically showing a scene view, asset management, and a properties panel. The layout suggests a focus on game development or 3D design.

### Key Elements
- **Scene View**: Located centrally, displaying a 3D environment with a rock formation and a small orange cube with a face.
- **Left Panel**: Contains a hierarchical structure labeled "Hierarchy" with various nodes listed under "My Assets," such as "Audio," "Texture," and "My Folder."
- **Right Panel**: Labeled "Properties," with options to select an object for viewing its properties.
- **Bottom Panel**: Named "Assets," showing a grid of icons representing different asset types like audio clips and textures.
- **Top Bar**: Includes navigation buttons and a search bar.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual is the central scene view. The hierarchy panel on the left provides a tree-like structure for navigating assets. The properties panel on the right is interactive, allowing selection of objects within the scene. The bottom assets panel lists available resources. There are no explicit arrows or lines connecting elements, but the layout implies a sequential interaction flow from selecting assets to viewing properties.
