## Content

### Overview
This image depicts a performance metrics overlay within a game interface. It displays various metrics related to frame time, scripting, audio, and avatar performance. The overlay includes graphs, numerical data, and interactive elements such as buttons and dropdowns.

### Key Elements
- **Performance Metrics Header**: Located at the top, labeled "Performance Metrics."
- **Frame Time Graph**: A horizontal line graph showing frame times over a timeline. The graph has a green line representing the frame time, with a blue highlighted area indicating a specific segment.
- **Timeline**: A horizontal axis labeled with numerical values representing frames.
- **Metric Exceeds Target Value Tooltip**: A tooltip appears near the timeline, stating "Metric exceeds target value," pointing to a specific point on the graph.
- **Scripting Section**: Contains numerical data under the heading "Scripting," including average, target, max, and min values.
- **Audio Section**: Similar to the Scripting section, contains numerical data under the heading "Audio."
- **Avatar Section**: Contains numerical data under the heading "Avatar."
- **Back Button**: Located at the bottom right corner, labeled "Back."

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual element is the Frame Time graph, which spans across the entire width of the overlay. The timeline below the graph provides context for the frame numbers. The Metric Exceeds Target Value tooltip draws attention to a specific issue in the frame time data. The sections for Scripting, Audio, and Avatar are stacked vertically beneath the Frame Time graph, each containing numerical data relevant to those metrics.
