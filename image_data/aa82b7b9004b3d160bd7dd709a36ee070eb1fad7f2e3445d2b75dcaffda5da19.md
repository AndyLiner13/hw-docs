## Content

### Overview
This image depicts a user interface element, specifically a settings panel within a software application. The panel includes a header, several configurable options, and a button at the bottom.

### Key Elements
- **Header**: Located at the top, it contains the title "sysCameraChangeTrigger..." which is partially obscured. It has a dark background with white text.
- **cameraMode**: Positioned below the header, this section displays the label "cameraMode" on the left side. To the right, there is a black rectangular button with the word "Collision" written in white.
- **cameraModeText**: Below "cameraMode," this section shows the label "cameraModeText." Next to it is another black rectangular button labeled "None (Object)" with a small circular icon next to the text.
- **Attachment Button**: At the bottom of the panel, there is a large button labeled "Attach script."

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual element is the header, as it sets the context for the rest of the panel. The elements are arranged vertically, with each setting option clearly separated by a thin horizontal line. The attachment button at the bottom is the least prominent but still noticeable due to its larger size compared to the other elements.
