## Content

### Overview
This image depicts a user interface element showing configuration settings for thresholds related to star ratings within a game or application. The layout is structured as a table with two columns: one for the threshold names and another for numerical values.

### Key Elements
- **Threshold Names Column**: Located in the left column, containing labels such as `oneStarThreshold`, `twoStarThreshold`, and `threeStarThreshold`.
- **Threshold Values Column**: Positioned to the right of the threshold names, displaying numerical values (`10`, `50`, `100`) corresponding to the respective thresholds.
- **Expandable Section Header**: At the top-left, there is a header that can be expanded or collapsed, indicated by a triangle icon and some placeholder text (`Progression_LevelSequenceConfigs:OverrideStarRatingThr...`). This suggests that more information might be available when expanded.
- **Three Dots Icon**: Positioned at the far right of the header, likely indicating additional options or settings related to the configuration.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual element is the expandable section header, which draws attention due to its larger size and distinct iconography. The thresholds and their values are arranged in a clear, tabular format, facilitating easy reading and comparison. There are no arrows or lines connecting elements, but the layout implies a logical progression from the header to the specific configurations listed below.
