## Content

### Overview
The image displays a user interface with two main sections: a hierarchical list on the left and a filtering panel on the right. The interface appears to be part of a software tool, possibly related to 3D modeling or game development, given the terms like "Spawn Point," "Cube," and "Tri-Mesh."

### Key Elements

### Visual Flow / Relationships
- **Most prominent visually:** The left panel is more prominent due to its larger size and the fact that it occupies the majority of the screen space.
- **Arrows/lines/connectors:** There are no explicit arrows or lines connecting elements within the panels.
- **Spatial relationships:** The left panel is adjacent to the right panel but does not overlap. The filtering panel is divided into expandable sections, suggesting a hierarchical relationship between the categories.
