## Content

### Overview
The image depicts a user interface for creating a thumbnail A/B test. It includes fields for entering a test name, setting traffic allocation, choosing a start date, and uploading test images. There are also previews of two different images labeled as "Original" and "Test."

### Key Elements
- **Test Name**: Located at the top left, this field prompts the user to give the test a unique name. The placeholder text reads: "Give your test a unique name. This name is not visible to the public." The field has a counter indicating "0/30" characters remaining.
- **Traffic Allocation**: Below the Test Name field, there’s a slider or input field set to 50%, indicating the percentage of traffic allocated to the test image.
- **Start Date**: Positioned below the Traffic Allocation field, this section allows users to select a start date for the test. The date shown is April 16, 2025.
- **Automatically Publish Test Images**: A checkbox option is available to automatically publish test images if they perform better.
- **Upload Test Image**: This section instructs users to upload a test image file. It specifies that images should be in JPEG or PNG format and must be 2560 x 1440 pixels in size. There’s a drag-and-drop area and a link to choose a file from the device.
- **Previews**: Two images are displayed side-by-side under the Preview section. The left image is labeled "Original," showing a cartoon-style farm scene with a pig wearing a red cap surrounded by animals. The right image is labeled "Test," depicting a more realistic farm scene with a person and animals inside a barn.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The layout is structured with clear sections for input fields and previews. The "Original" and "Test" images are prominently displayed, drawing attention to the comparison being made. The start date and traffic allocation fields are positioned above the upload area, suggesting a logical sequence for completing the form before uploading the images.
