## Content

### Overview
This image depicts a state diagram or flowchart illustrating transitions between states related to attaching and detaching an attachable entity to a player. The diagram includes two main states: "Detached" and "Attached," with transitions triggered by specific events and actions.

### Key Elements
- **Detached State**: Located at the top of the diagram, represented by a purple oval labeled "Detached." It has a green arrow pointing downward to the "Attached" state.
- **Attached State**: Located at the bottom of the diagram, represented by another purple oval labeled "Attached." It has a red arrow pointing upward to the "Detached" state.
- **Events and Actions**: 
  - **player releases attachable entity on body part**: This event leads to the "OnAttachStart" state within the "Detached" state.
  - **attachToPlayer()**: This action transitions from "OnAttachStart" to "Attached."
  - **player grabs attachable entity**: This event leads to the "OnGrabStart" state within the "Detached" state.
  - **detach()**: This action transitions from "Attached" back to "Detached."
  - **ownership transfer**: This label appears under the "OnGrabEnd" state, indicating a transition point.
- **Transitions**: Arrows indicate the flow of transitions between states and events. Green arrows represent transitions initiated by the player releasing or grabbing the attachable entity, while red arrows represent the transition when the detach action is performed.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
- **Most Prominent Element**: The central focus is the circular flow between the "Detached" and "Attached" states.
- **Arrows and Lines**: Green arrows connect the "Detached" state to the "Attached" state via the "OnAttachStart" and "OnGrabStart" events, and red arrows connect the "Attached" state back to the "Detached" state via the "detach()" action.
- **Spatial Relationships**: The states are arranged in a circular flow, with the "Detached" state at the top and the "Attached" state at the bottom, indicating a continuous cycle of attachment and detachment.
