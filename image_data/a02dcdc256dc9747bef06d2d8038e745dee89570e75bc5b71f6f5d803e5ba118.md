## Content

### Overview
This image depicts a user interface from a software application, likely related to game development or 3D modeling, given the presence of a cube and text editing features. The interface includes a sidebar with a hierarchy of entities, a central workspace displaying a 3D cube, and a properties panel on the right side.

### Key Elements
- **Sidebar (Left Panel)**: Contains a list of entities with names like "SpawnPoint," "messageReceiver," and "Cube." The "Text" entity is highlighted in blue.
- **Central Workspace**: Displays a 3D cube with a blue outline and a green dot at its center, indicating a point of interest or selection. Text is placed within the cube, reading "You can write text here! Formatting is also supported!" with a red arrow pointing towards the text.
- **Properties Panel (Right Panel)**: Includes sections labeled "Behavior," "Attributes," and "GameplayTags." The "Behavior" section has a text input field showing the same text as in the cube. Below it, there are checkboxes for "Auto Fit" and "Visible," both checked. The "Attributes" section displays position, rotation, scale, and color settings for the selected object. The "GameplayTags" section contains a search bar for attaching tags.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The layout follows a typical workflow where the left sidebar provides navigation, the central workspace shows the current selection, and the right properties panel offers editing options. The text within the cube is the focal point, drawing attention to the text formatting feature.
