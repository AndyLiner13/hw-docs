## Content

### Overview
The image displays a user interface from a game development environment, specifically showing a pop-up window titled "Edit Leaderboard." The window contains various settings related to leaderboard management, such as name, sort order, reset frequency, and whether to set the leaderboard as default. The background shows a 3D modeling workspace with a grid and a gradient sky.

### Key Elements
- **Pop-up Window**: Located centrally, it has a dark blue background with white text and light blue accents.
  - **Title**: "Edit Leaderboard"
  - **Name Input**: "Most wins"
  - **Sort Order**: "Descending" with a dropdown arrow indicating more options.
  - **Reset Frequency**: "Never" with a dropdown arrow.
  - **Persistent Variable Option**: A toggle switch that is off.
  - **Set as Default**: A toggle switch that is on, highlighted in blue.
  - **Buttons**: Two buttons labeled "Cancel" and "Save," both with a blue background and white text.
- **Background Workspace**: A 3D modeling environment with a grid floor and a gradient sky.
- **Sidebar**: On the left, it includes a hierarchy view with nodes like "SpawnPoint," "geometry_0," "WorldLeaderboard," "Shop," and "Shop Button."
- **Asset Library**: At the bottom, it shows a list of assets with icons and names like "tall_palm," "space_shuttle," and "Beautiful Dark."

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The pop-up window is the most prominent visual element, drawing attention due to its central placement and contrasting color scheme. The buttons at the bottom of the pop-up suggest a typical interaction pattern where users can either cancel changes or save them. The workspace in the background provides context for the game development environment but does not interact with the pop-up directly.
