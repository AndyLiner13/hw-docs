## Content

### Overview
This image depicts a user interface of a 3D modeling or asset management software. The central area shows a 3D scene with a red sphere and some icons above it. On the right side, there is a panel displaying asset details. The left sidebar contains a hierarchical structure of assets, and at the bottom, there are tabs labeled "Assets" and "Tests."

### Key Elements
- **Central Scene**: A 3D environment with a red sphere and two icons above it (a purple cube and a green microphone).
- **Icons Above the Sphere**: Two icons are positioned above the red sphere, one purple and one green.
- **Right Panel**: Contains asset details such as asset type, ID, owner, creation date, and version information. It also includes a "Replace asset" button.
- **Left Sidebar**: Displays a hierarchical structure of assets under categories like "My Assets," "Test Assets," and "Audio Library Test Assets."
- **Tabs at Bottom**: Two tabs labeled "Assets" and "Tests" are visible at the bottom of the screen.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual element is the central 3D scene. The icons above the sphere are likely interactive elements related to the sphere's properties. The right panel provides detailed information about the selected asset, while the left sidebar allows navigation through different asset categories. The tabs at the bottom suggest functionality for switching between different views or functionalities within the software.
