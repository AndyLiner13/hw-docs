## Content

### Overview
This image depicts a 3D modeling software interface, specifically showing a scene with various objects labeled as "Type1," "Type2," "Type3," etc., arranged on a grid floor. The central focus is on a highlighted object labeled "Bow," which is surrounded by a red bounding box. The right side of the interface displays properties related to the highlighted object, such as "Holster Icon" and "Holster Custom Icon."

### Key Elements
- **Scene**: A 3D workspace with a grid floor and various objects labeled with "Type1," "Type2," etc.
- **Highlighted Object**: A wooden block labeled "Bow" with a red bounding box around it.
- **Bounding Box**: A red rectangular outline surrounding the "Bow" object.
- **Properties Panel**: Located on the right side, displaying properties like "Holster Icon" set to "Rocket" and "Holster Custom Icon" with a numerical ID.
- **Hierarchy Panel**: On the left, showing a list of objects with labels like "Shield," "Sword," "Bow," etc.
- **Asset Browser**: At the bottom, showing a grid of icons representing different assets, some of which are labeled with "shield_action_," "staff_holster_," etc.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual element is the red bounding box around the "Bow" object. The properties panel on the right is connected to the highlighted object via a red arrow, indicating a relationship or action being performed. The hierarchy panel on the left shows the structure of the project, while the asset browser at the bottom displays available assets.
