## Content

### Overview
This image depicts a file explorer window showing a directory structure related to 3D modeling assets. The focus is on a list of .fbx files, specifically those named "DamagedHelmet_LOD0.fbx," "DamagedHelmet_LOD1.fbx," and "DamagedHelmet_LOD2.fbx." These files appear to be low-resolution versions of a damaged helmet model. The window includes navigation controls, a search bar, and a list of folders and files on the left side.

### Key Elements
- **File Explorer Window**: The main area displaying the file list.
    - **Left Panel**: Contains a tree view of directories, starting from "horizon" and expanding into subdirectories like "Captures," "LOD tests," "trimesh," etc.
    - **Right Panel**: Lists the contents of the selected directory, showing file names, sizes, and modification dates.
        - **Highlighted Files**: "DamagedHelmet_LOD0.fbx," "DamagedHelmet_LOD1.fbx," and "DamagedHelmet_LOD2.fbx" are highlighted with a red circle, indicating selection.
        - **Other Files**: Other .fbx files like "ColumnSetA_LOD0.fbx," "StoneFloor_LOD0.fbx," and "Suzanne_LOD0.fbx" are listed but not highlighted.
    - **Navigation Controls**: Located at the top left, showing the current path as "fbsource > arvr > projects > socialvr > data > models > enginetest > trimesh > lod."
    - **Search Bar**: Positioned at the top right, with the placeholder text "Search lod."
    - **Buttons**: At the bottom right, there are "Open" and "Cancel" buttons, both circled in red.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
