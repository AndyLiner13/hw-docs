### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual element is the grid of gemstones, which takes up the majority of the screen. The booster options are secondary but still noticeable due to their placement below the main gameplay area. The goal indicators and timer provide contextual information about the game's objectives and time constraints. The character figure adds a playful element to the interface, suggesting a narrative or character-driven aspect to the game.
