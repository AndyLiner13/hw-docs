- **Dropdown Menu**: Appears as a vertical list of options under the menu icon. The options include "Return to Creation Home," "View Application Logs," "Launch TypeScript Editor," "Publish World," "Rename World," "Save Backup," "Backups," "Export Geometry," "Keyboard Shortcuts," "Player Settings," "Report a Problem," "Help us Improve," "Help Center," and "Close Desktop Editor."
- **Highlighted Option**: "Export Geometry" is highlighted with a yellow circle and a cursor pointing towards it.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual element is the dropdown menu, which is the focal point of the image. The options within the menu are arranged vertically, and the highlighted option draws attention due to its distinct highlighting effect. The right section of the interface, featuring the blue icon and transform tools, is secondary but still important for understanding the context of the application.
