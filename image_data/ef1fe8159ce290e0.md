## Content

### Overview
This image depicts a user interface for managing leaderboards within a system, likely part of a game development tool or platform. The interface includes a sidebar menu on the left and a main content area on the right displaying leaderboard settings. A dropdown menu for reset frequency is open, showing options such as "Never," "Daily," "Weekly," and "Monthly."

### Key Elements
- **Sidebar Menu**: Located on the left side, with a dark background and white text. Contains options like "Systems," "Quests," "Leaderboards," "Player Variables," and "Variable Groups." The "Leaderboards" option is highlighted with a purple underline.
- **Main Content Area**: On the right, the title "Leaderboards" is displayed at the top. Below it, there are two leaderboard entries labeled "leaderboard" with icons resembling trophies. The first entry has a "Daily" reset frequency, and the second has a "Never" reset frequency. There are fields for "Name" and "Sort Order," both currently set to "leaderboard" and "Descending," respectively. A dropdown menu for sorting order is partially visible.
- **Dropdown Menu**: Opened in the lower right, showing reset frequency options ("Never," "Daily," "Weekly," "Monthly") with descriptions underneath each option.
- **Create Leaderboard Button**: Located at the top right corner, with a blue background and white text.
- **Edit Leaderboard Button**: Positioned near the top right, with a white background and black text.
- **Cancel Button**: At the bottom of the main content area, with a light gray background and black text.
- **Time Display**: At the very bottom, showing "12:49 PM."
- **Grid Background**: A light gray grid pattern serves as the background for the entire interface.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual element is the dropdown menu for reset frequency, which is open and draws attention due to its lighter background compared to the rest of the interface. The main content area is structured with clear sections for leaderboard management, and the sidebar menu provides navigation options. The time display at the bottom is a static element that does not interact with the interface but provides context about when the screenshot was taken.
