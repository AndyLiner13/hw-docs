### Overview
This image depicts a sequence diagram illustrating the interactions between various components in a game system. The diagram shows how different entities communicate with each other through messages and events. Components include Player, Game, ScoreManager, ComboTracker, StarRating, XP Relay, XP Manager, PlayerProfile, and Achievements.

### Key Elements
- **Player**: Located at the far left, represented as a yellow rectangle. It sends a message "Complete Match" to the Game.
- **Game**: A blue rectangle located next to the Player. It receives the "Complete Match" message and responds with "Calculate Score."
- **ScoreManager**: A green rectangle. It receives the "Calculate Score" message and sends back a "Return Multiplier" message.
- **ComboTracker**: Another green rectangle. It receives the "Update Multiplier" message and calculates stars.
- **StarRating**: A green rectangle. It calculates stars and sends a message "STAR_RATING_CALCULATED" to the XP Relay.
- **XP Relay**: A purple rectangle. It receives the "STAR_RATING_CALCULATED" message and awards XP.
- **XP Manager**: A purple rectangle. It receives the "Award XP" message and checks if the threshold is met.
- **PlayerProfile**: A purple rectangle. It receives the "Add XP" message and checks if the threshold is met.
- **Achievements**: A purple rectangle. It receives the "Check Threshold" message and awards bonus XP.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The diagram uses arrows to indicate the direction of communication between components. The most prominent visual elements are the messages being sent and received between the components. The sequence starts with the Player completing a match, which triggers a series of calculations and updates that ultimately lead to XP being awarded and achievements being unlocked.
