## Content

### Overview
This image depicts a user interface element from a software application, specifically a chat or messaging feature. The interface includes a header indicating "Gen AI BETA," a menu icon, and a button labeled "New Chat."

### Key Elements
- **Header**: Located at the top-left corner. Contains the text "Gen AI BETA." The "BETA" text is within a green oval shape.
- **Menu Icon**: Positioned to the left of the header. It consists of three horizontal lines stacked vertically, resembling a menu icon.
- **Button**: Situated below the header and to the right of the menu icon. It has a gray background with a white icon that appears to be a chat bubble with a plus sign inside, suggesting the creation of a new chat.
- **Dropdown Menu**: Below the button, a black dropdown menu is partially visible with the text "New Chat" displayed.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual element is the "New Chat" button, as it is centrally located and larger than the other elements. The header is the secondary focal point, providing context about the application. The menu icon is less prominent but still noticeable due to its distinct shape. The dropdown menu is a tertiary element, serving as a functional extension of the "New Chat" button.
