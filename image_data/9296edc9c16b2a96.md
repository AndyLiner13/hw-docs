## Content

### Overview
This image depicts a notification message box with a green checkmark icon and some text indicating that an asset has been restored. The box is set against a dark background, and there's a small 'X' button at the top right corner for closing the message.

### Key Elements
- **Visual description**: A rectangular notification box with rounded corners.
- **Location**: Centered horizontally and vertically within the image.
- **Contents**: Contains a green checkmark icon on the left side, followed by the text "> Your asset has been restored to adfasdf afkdfalk;df". There's also a small 'X' button on the far right.
- **Visual styling**: The background is dark gray, the text is white, and the checkmark is green. The 'X' button is white with a black outline.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual element is the notification box itself. The checkmark icon and the text are closely aligned to the left, while the 'X' button is isolated to the right. There are no arrows or lines connecting elements, but the layout suggests a typical user interface design where the message is the primary focus, and the 'X' button is for interaction.
