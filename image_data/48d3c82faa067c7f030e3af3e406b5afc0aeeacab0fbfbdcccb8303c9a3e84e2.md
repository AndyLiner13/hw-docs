## Content

### Overview
This image depicts a user interface element showing a hierarchical structure, likely from a 3D modeling software or game development tool. The main focus is on a tree-like structure displaying various nodes, with a search bar at the top for navigating through the hierarchy.

### Key Elements
- **Search Bar**: Located at the top, spanning the width of the interface. Contains a magnifying glass icon and the placeholder text "> Search hierarchy <".
- **Hierarchy Tree**: Positioned below the search bar, occupying the majority of the screen. It consists of expandable nodes labeled `[Spawn Point]`, `Cube`, `Cone`, and `Sphere`.
  - **[Spawn Point]**: A node with a small icon resembling a person, located above the `Cube` node.
  - **Cube**: A node highlighted in blue, indicating selection or active status. It has a small icon resembling a cube.
  - **Cone**: A node with a small icon resembling a cone, located below the `Cube` node.
  - **Sphere**: A node with a small icon resembling a sphere, located below the `Cone` node.
- **Expand/Collapse Icons**: Small triangle icons next to each node, suggesting that clicking them would expand or collapse the subtree beneath.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual element is the `Cube` node, which is highlighted in blue. The expand/collapse icons indicate a hierarchical relationship, with the `Cube` node being the parent of `Cone` and `Sphere`. The search bar at the top suggests a way to navigate through the hierarchy efficiently.
