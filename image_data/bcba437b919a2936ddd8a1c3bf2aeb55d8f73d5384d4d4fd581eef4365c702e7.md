## Content

### Overview
This image depicts a user interface from a development environment, likely related to game development or 3D modeling, showing performance metrics and asset management. The layout includes a sidebar, a performance graph, and a table listing assets.

### Key Elements
- **Sidebar (Left Panel)**: Contains a list of objects named "SpawnPoint," "SmoothCylinder," and "Cube." These appear to be nodes or entities within the project.
- **Performance Graph (Center)**: A large area displaying performance metrics over time. It includes categories like "GPU," "Physics," "Scripting," "Audio," "Avatar," "Calls," and "Animations." Each category has a corresponding line graph showing performance targets and maximum values.
- **Table (Right Panel)**: Titled "Assets," it lists mesh assets with columns for "NAME," "USED BY MEMORY," "FORMAT TRIANGLES," "VERTICES COUNT," and "COUNT." Each row represents a mesh asset with specific numerical values.
- **Header Bar (Top)**: Contains various icons and options such as "Hierarchy," "Local Pivot," "View," "Switch to VR," and "Publish."

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual elements are the performance graph and the asset table. The graph is centrally located, while the asset table is positioned to the right. The sidebar on the left provides context for the assets listed in the table. There are no explicit arrows or lines connecting elements, but the layout suggests a logical flow from the sidebar to the performance graph and then to the asset table.
