## Content

### Overview
This image depicts a user interface for a programming environment, specifically a block-based scripting tool named "Runtime Manager." The interface is designed for creating scripts using visual blocks that represent code logic. The blocks are arranged in a vertical sequence, forming a script flow.

### Key Elements
- **Title Bar**: Located at the top, labeled "Runtime Manager."
- **Block Editor**: A series of interconnected blocks forming a script. Blocks include operations such as "Spawn asset," "Set," "When," "If," "While," "Delete spawned object," and "Clear."
- **Input Fields**: Some blocks contain input fields with placeholders like "# objIdx" and "# objList."
- **Event Trigger**: A block labeled "when despawnEvent is received with + New Param."
- **Conditional Logic**: An "If" block checks the length of "[ ] objList" against zero.
- **Loop Structure**: A "While" loop iterates over the "[ ] objList."
- **Script Status**: At the bottom left, a green checkmark indicates "No Errors," and at the bottom right, "Script Mode: Default" is displayed.
- **Script Capacity**: Shown as "6%."

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The blocks are arranged vertically, with some horizontal connections indicating the flow of the script. The most prominent elements are the conditional "If" block and the "While" loop, which form the core logic of the script. Arrows and lines connect the blocks, showing the sequence of execution.
