## Content

### Overview
This image depicts a virtual environment within a game, specifically a shop interface and a character standing in front of a signboard providing first-time user experience (FTUE) information. The scene includes a shop window displaying items, a character model, and a signboard with text.

### Key Elements
- **Shop Window**: Located on the left side of the image, it has a blue background with a yellow border. Contains an item labeled "Green Pickaxe" with a price tag of 300. The item description states, "This pickaxe is perfect for mining Green. Your first purchase." There is a green "PURCHASE" button below the description.
- **Character Model**: Positioned centrally in the image, facing away from the viewer. The character is wearing a brown backpack, a gray shirt, blue jeans, and white shoes.
- **Signboard**: On the right side of the image, it has a wooden frame with a black background and white text that reads, "FIRST-TIME USER EXPERIENCE. The FTUE is a common way to introduce players to the game. Purchase a Green Pickaxe before stepping on the teleporter. See the FTUEZone.ts file to learn more."
- **Background**: The walls are tiled with a yellow and orange pattern. The floor is a light gray tile.
- **User Interface Elements**: At the top left, there are icons for menu, pause, and internal settings. At the top right, there are icons for chat, profile, and settings, along with numerical indicators for various resources (e.g., 30, 0, 0).

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual elements are the shop window and the signboard. The character model is positioned between them, serving as a focal point. Arrows or lines are not present, but the layout suggests a linear reading order moving from the shop window to the character and then to the signboard.
