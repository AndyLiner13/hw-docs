## Content

### Overview
The image depicts a 3D modeling interface showing a red cube with blue edges and a floating control panel. The cube has some interactive elements marked with small spheres and a green square on its surface. The control panel is a floating window with various settings related to the cube's behavior, attributes, physics, and more.

### Key Elements
- **Cube**: A red cube with blue edges, located in the foreground. It has small spheres marked on its surface and a green square on one side.
- **Control Panel**: A floating window with a dark background and light text. It contains tabs labeled "Behavior," "Attributes," "Physics," and "More." There are toggles for "Visible," "Light & Shadow," and "Collidable," with "Collidable" set to "On." Other sections include "Motion" options like "None," "Animated," and "Interactive."
- **Floating Window**: The control panel is a rectangular window with rounded corners, positioned above the cube. It has a close button ("X") at the top right corner.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
- **Most Prominent Element**: The red cube is the most prominent visual due to its size and central placement.
- **Arrows/Connectors**: There are no arrows or connectors visible in the image.
- **Spatial Relationships**: The control panel is floating above the cube, suggesting interaction between the two. The cube's surface elements indicate interactivity, likely controlled through the panel.
