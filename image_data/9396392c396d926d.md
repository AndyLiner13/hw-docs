## Content

### Overview
This image depicts a user interface of a 3D modeling or game development software. The layout includes a sidebar with a hierarchy view, a central viewport showing a 3D scene, and a properties panel on the right side. The bottom section features an asset library with folders and assets displayed.

### Key Elements
- **Sidebar (Left Panel)**: Contains a hierarchical list of objects labeled "SpawnPoint," "WorldInit," "Leaderboard-TextLabel," "Quest-TextLabel," "Common," and "z Unused." Each item has a small icon next to it.
- **Central Viewport**: Displays a 3D scene with a blue sky gradient and a grid floor. There are two small objects in the scene: one orange cube and one teal cube with a speaker icon.
- **Properties Panel (Right Panel)**: Currently empty, with a placeholder message stating "Select an object to view its properties."
- **Asset Library Section**: Located at the bottom of the interface. It includes tabs for "Asset Library," "Console," "Tests," and "Performance." The "Asset Library" tab is active, and within it, there are sections for "Public Assets" and "My Assets." "My Assets" is further divided into "All Assets," "My Folders," and "Removed Assets." Icons representing different asset types (text, audio, and another text asset) are visible under "All Assets."

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual elements are the sidebar and the central viewport. The viewport is the largest area, serving as the main workspace. The sidebar provides navigation through the project hierarchy, while the properties panel and asset library provide additional functionality. The asset library is the focal point of the bottom section, with the "My Assets" folder being highlighted.
