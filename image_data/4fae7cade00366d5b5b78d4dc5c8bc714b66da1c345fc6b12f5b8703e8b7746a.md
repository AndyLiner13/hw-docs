The image depicts a user interface of a game development environment, specifically showing a scene preview within a level editor. The scene appears to be a foggy, eerie graveyard at night, with a purple and pink gradient sky. The interface includes panels for navigation, variable groups, and properties, suggesting a focus on level design and asset management.

### Key Elements

- **Variable Groups Panel**: Above the scene preview, with tabs for "Hierarchy" and "Variable Groups," indicating tools for managing game assets and variables.
- **Properties Panel**: On the right, currently empty, with a placeholder icon and prompt to select an object to view its properties.
- **Scene Controls**: At the top, there are options for viewing the scene in different modes ("Relative," "Absolute," etc.), and a scale indicator.
