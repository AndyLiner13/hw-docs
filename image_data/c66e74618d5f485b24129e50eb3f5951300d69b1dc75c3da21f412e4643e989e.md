### Overview
This image depicts a simple diagram illustrating the concept of visibility toggling between "On" and "Off." It uses geometric shapes and labels to represent the states.

### Key Elements
- **Top Panel ("Visibility On")**: Contains a green hexagon, a smaller green pentagon, and a larger green pentagon. The text "Visibility On" is written above them.
- **Bottom Panel ("Visibility Off")**: Contains a red hexagon and a red star with a small white star inside it. The text "Visibility Off" is written above the red star.
- **Door**: A yellow rectangle labeled "Door" is located between the two panels.
- **Red Star**: A red star with a small white star inside it is positioned near the bottom right of the "Visibility Off" panel.
- **Red Hexagon**: A red hexagon is located near the bottom left of the "Visibility Off" panel.
- **Line**: A diagonal line connects the top panel to the bottom panel, suggesting a transition or relationship between the two states.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual elements are the two panels representing "Visibility On" and "Visibility Off." The diagonal line connecting the two suggests a transition or comparison between the two states. The door element is placed centrally between the two panels, possibly indicating a boundary or a point of interaction between the two states.
