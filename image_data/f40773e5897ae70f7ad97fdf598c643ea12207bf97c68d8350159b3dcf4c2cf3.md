## Content

### Overview
This image displays a settings interface with adjustable parameters for camera settings in both landscape and portrait modes. The layout is structured with two expandable sections, each containing multiple configuration options.

### Key Elements
- **Landscape Section**:
  - **Camera Auto Follow Delay**: Located in the top-left area, the value is set to `2`.
  - **Enable Continuous Rotation**: Positioned to the right of the delay setting, this option has a toggle switch that is currently off.
  - **Camera Distance**: Found below the continuous rotation toggle, its value is `5`.
  - **Allow Horizon Levelling**: Below the camera distance, this option also has a toggle switch, which is off.
  - **Rotation Rate**: Positioned below the horizon levelling toggle, its value is `1`.
  - **Camera Vertical Offset**: At the bottom of the landscape section, its value is `0`.

- **Portrait Section**:
  - **Camera Auto Follow Delay**: Located in the top-left area, the value is set to `2`.
  - **Enable Continuous Rotation**: Positioned to the right of the delay setting, this option has a toggle switch that is currently off.
  - **Camera Distance**: Below the continuous rotation toggle, its value is `6.5`.
  - **Allow Horizon Levelling**: Below the camera distance, this option has a toggle switch that is currently on.
  - **Rotation Rate**: Positioned below the horizon levelling toggle, its value is `1`.
  - **Camera Vertical Offset**: At the bottom of the portrait section, its value is `0.5`.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The interface is organized into two main sections, each with its own set of parameters. The parameters within each section are arranged vertically, with the most prominent elements being the toggle switches for enabling features. The visual hierarchy is clear due to the distinct separation of the two sections.
