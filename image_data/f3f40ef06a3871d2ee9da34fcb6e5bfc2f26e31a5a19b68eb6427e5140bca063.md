## Content

### Overview
This image depicts a user interface screen from a software application, specifically a section related to backups. The layout includes a sidebar menu on the left and a main content area on the right. The sidebar has options such as "World," "Publish," "Backups," "Players Settings," "Capacity," and "Experimental." The main content area displays backup information and restoration options.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual elements are the sidebar menu and the main content area. The sidebar menu is static and serves as a navigation tool. The main content area dynamically updates based on the selected option. The restore buttons are arranged vertically beneath the backup entries, suggesting a sequential process for restoring previous versions of the world.
