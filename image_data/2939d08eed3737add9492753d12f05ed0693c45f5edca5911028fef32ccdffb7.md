### Overview
This image depicts a settings or configuration interface section titled "Behavior." It contains several toggle switches, dropdown menus, and labels related to behavior settings.

### Key Elements
- **Toggle Switches**: Located in the right column, these are interactive elements that can be toggled on or off. The labels are "Visible" and "Collidable," both of which are currently enabled as indicated by the blue indicator next to them.
- **Dropdown Menus**: Positioned to the right of the labels "Collision Layer," "Motion," and "Interaction." These menus allow selection of options from a dropdown list.
- **Labels**: These are descriptive texts such as "Visible," "Collidable," "Collision Layer," "Motion," and "Interaction."

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The layout is structured with labels on the left and corresponding interactive elements (toggle switches and dropdown menus) on the right. The toggle switches are more prominent due to their larger size and distinct blue indicators compared to the smaller dropdown menus.
