### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual element is the search bar at the top. The script content area is the second most prominent, as it contains the main functionality of the interface. There are no arrows or lines connecting elements, but the layout suggests a linear reading order moving from the search bar down to the script content area.
