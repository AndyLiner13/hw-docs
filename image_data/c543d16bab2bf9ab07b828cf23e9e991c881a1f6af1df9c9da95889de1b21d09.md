## Content

### Overview
This image depicts a user interface from a software development environment, likely a game engine or a visual scripting tool. The central area shows a 3D scene with a character model and some nodes representing code blocks. The left panel displays a hierarchical list of entities, while the right panel contains properties and attributes related to the selected entity.

### Key Elements
- **Left Panel (Hierarchy)**: Located on the left side, it shows a tree-like structure with various entities listed. The currently selected entity is highlighted in blue. Text includes "Send String Entity," "Message Receiver," and others.
- **Central Scene**: The middle area displays a 3D environment with a grid floor and a character model standing in the center. There are three purple nodes labeled "SendStringToCodeblocks_Entity," "SendStringToCodeblocks_Entity," and "Send Strings." A small red arrow points towards one of the nodes.
- **Right Panel (Properties)**: On the right side, there is a panel displaying properties of the selected entity. It includes fields such as "Behavior," "Attributes," "GameplayTags," and "Script." The "Behavior" section has a text field containing "Send<br>String." Other fields show numerical values for position, rotation, scale, and color.
- **Character Model**: Positioned centrally in the scene, it is a simple humanoid figure with a blue outline.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual elements are the nodes in the central scene, which are interconnected through the red arrow. The hierarchy on the left and the properties on the right provide contextual information about the selected node. The red arrow suggests a connection or interaction between the nodes.
