### Overview
This image depicts a confirmation dialog box asking if the user wants to erase an asset named "Lobby." The dialog box contains information about the consequences of erasing the asset and two buttons at the bottom for canceling or erasing the action.

### Key Elements

      - "Permanently delete Lobby from your library and cannot be undone."
    - Second paragraph: "It will not:"
      - "Erase the asset from any other libraries or worlds where it may exist. For example, if a collaborator on one of your worlds added it to their library it will still exist there and wherever they've used it in their worlds."
  - **Buttons**: Two buttons at the bottom, one labeled "Cancel" and the other "Erase," both with rounded corners and a gradient from light gray to darker gray.
