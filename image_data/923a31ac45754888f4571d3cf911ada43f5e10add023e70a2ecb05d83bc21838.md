### Overview
This image depicts a user interface element within a software application, specifically a modal window titled "New asset." The modal is designed for creating a new asset, with various fields and options available for input. The background shows a virtual environment with a grid floor and a sunset sky, suggesting a 3D modeling or game development tool.

### Key Elements
- **Modal Window**: A dark gray modal window with rounded corners, centered on the screen.
  - **Title**: "New asset" at the top.
  - **Name Field**: Below the title, a text field labeled "Name" with the placeholder text "Bouncy Boxes" and a counter "0/40" indicating character limit.
  - **Description Field**: Below the name field, a text area labeled "Description" containing the text "> The boxes bounce when you drop them on the floor. The animation curves...".
  - **Folder Dropdown**: To the right of the description field, a dropdown menu labeled "Folder" with the selected option "My Assets."
  - **Thumbnail Section**: Below the folder dropdown, a section labeled "Thumbnail" showing a small thumbnail image of a white bear.
  - **Object Selection Section**: At the bottom, a section labeled "Object selection (optional)" explaining that changing the object selection allows choosing which objects make up the asset. Below this, a button labeled "Change" is visible.
  - **Buttons**: At the bottom of the modal, two buttons labeled "Cancel" and "Create."

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The modal is the most prominent visual element, drawing attention due to its central placement and darker color contrast against the lighter background. The form fields are arranged vertically, with the name field at the top, followed by the description field, then the folder dropdown, thumbnail section, and finally the object selection section. The buttons at the bottom provide clear actions for canceling or creating the asset.
