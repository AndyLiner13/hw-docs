## Content

### Overview
The image depicts a digital interface, likely from a 3D modeling or asset management software. The central focus is a rendered scene featuring a tunnel leading through a snowy mountain landscape under a vibrant aurora sky. On the right side, there is a chat-like interface showing generated images related to the scene described in the input prompt above the chat area. Below the main scene, there is an assets panel displaying various folders and generated skybox thumbnails.

### Key Elements
- **Central Scene**: A tunnel leading through a snowy mountain range with a glowing aurora in the sky. The aurora displays a gradient of colors including green, yellow, purple, and pink.
- **Right Panel**: Contains a chat interface with three generated images of the aurora and snowy mountains. Each image has a thumbs-up and thumbs-down icon below it.
- **Bottom Panel**: An assets panel with a folder named "My Assets" expanded, showing several thumbnail images labeled as "generated_sky..." indicating skybox assets.
- **Left Panel**: Contains navigation options such as "Assets," "Console," and "Tests." There is also a dropdown menu for adding new assets and a search bar for finding assets.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
- The most prominent visual is the central scene of the aurora and tunnel.
- Arrows or lines are not present, but the layout suggests a linear reading order moving from left to right across the interface.
- Elements are arranged in a grid-like structure within the assets panel, with the chat interface on the right side providing additional context to the generated content.
