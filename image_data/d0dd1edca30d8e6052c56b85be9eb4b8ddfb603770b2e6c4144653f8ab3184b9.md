### Overview
The image displays a user interface for managing A/B testing experiments within a creative tool. It features a table listing various tests with columns for Name, Target, Type, Status, Winner, Start date, and Completion date. There are filters at the top for selecting worlds, statuses, and dates, along with a search bar. The interface also includes navigation options on the left side.

### Key Elements
