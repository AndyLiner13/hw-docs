### Overview
The image depicts a user interface of a 3D modeling or game development software environment. The central area shows a 3D scene with a grid floor and walls, suggesting a workspace for designing environments. The top bar contains various menu options and tool buttons. On the right side, there's a sidebar labeled "Collaborators," indicating a feature for managing team members. The bottom displays a notification about sending collaborator invites.
