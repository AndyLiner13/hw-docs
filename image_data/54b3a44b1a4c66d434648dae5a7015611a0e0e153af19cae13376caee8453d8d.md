## Content

### Overview
This image depicts a 3D modeling interface, likely from a game development tool, showing a cube object in a 3D workspace. The workspace has a grid background, and the cube is highlighted with axes handles for rotation and scaling. On the right side, there is a properties panel displaying various attributes of the cube.

### Key Elements
- **Cube**: A white cube with blue edges, located centrally in the workspace. It has red, green, and blue axes handles at its center.
- **Axes Handles**: Three colored handles (red, green, blue) indicating the axes for rotation and scaling.
- **Workspace Background**: An orange grid background representing the 3D space.
- **Properties Panel**: Located on the right side, with a dark background. Contains sections labeled "Properties," "Behavior," "Attributes," "Physics," "More," and "Navigation." The "Navigation" section includes a toggle switch labeled "Navigable Surface."
- **Attached Script**: Below the "Navigation" section, there is a dropdown labeled "Attached Script" set to "None."

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual element is the cube in the center of the workspace. The axes handles are positioned at the center of the cube. The properties panel on the right provides contextual information about the cube. There are no arrows or lines connecting elements, but the layout suggests a typical user interface where the workspace is the primary area for interaction, and the properties panel offers additional settings.
