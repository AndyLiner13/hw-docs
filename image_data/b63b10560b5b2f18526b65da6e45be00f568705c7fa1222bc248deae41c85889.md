## Content

### Overview
The image displays a graphical user interface (GUI) window with a timeline and various data visualizations. The timeline is marked with numerical timestamps along the x-axis, and there are multiple lines representing different data series. A cursor is pointing at a specific point on the graph, indicating a particular frame number and latency value.

### Key Elements
- **Timeline**: Located horizontally across the middle of the GUI. Contains numerical timestamps such as 21533, 21742, 22160, etc.
- **Data Series**: Two main lines are visible, one green and one orange, representing different metrics over time.
- **Cursor**: A white arrow points to a specific frame number (22565) and latency value (0.616 ms) on the orange line.
- **Frame Counter**: Below the timeline, labeled "frames," with numbers like 22336, 22394, etc.
- **Latency Values**: Small text boxes showing latency times (e.g., 0.616 ms, 0.624 ms) near the cursor.
- **Play Controls**: A small set of icons at the bottom left, including play, pause, and step controls.
- **Background**: A blurred scene with indistinct shapes and colors, suggesting a virtual environment or game setting.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
- **Most Prominent Element**: The cursor and the highlighted frame number and latency value.
- **Arrows/Connections**: The cursor arrow points directly to the specific frame and latency value.
- **Spatial Relationships**: The timeline spans the width of the GUI, with the data series and frame counter below it. The play controls are positioned at the bottom left.
