### Overview
This image depicts a settings dialog box titled "Script Settings." It contains a sidebar menu with options such as "Script editing," "API," and "Console." The main content area displays a list of API options under the "API" tab, with toggle switches next to each option. At the bottom, there are two buttons labeled "Cancel" and "Apply."

### Key Elements
- **Sidebar Menu**: Located on the left side, with a dark gray background. Contains three options: "Script editing," "API," and "Console." Each option has a white label.
- **API Tab**: Located in the main content area, with a dark gray background. Contains a list of API options: "horizon/experimental," "horizon/testing," "horizon/2p," "horizon/analytics," "horizon/performance," "horizon/navmesh," and "horizon/test_bridge." Each API name is in white text.
- **Toggle Switches**: Located to the right of each API option, with a dark gray background and a white toggle handle. Some toggles are in the "off" position, while one ("horizon/test_bridge") is in the "on" position.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual element is the "API" tab, as it occupies the largest portion of the main content area. The toggle switches are arranged vertically next to the API names. The "Cancel" and "Apply" buttons are at the bottom, with the "Apply" button being more prominent due to its blue highlight.
