## Content

### Overview
This image displays a performance metrics window overlaid on a game environment. The window contains various performance indicators such as FPS, CPU usage, GPU usage, and wait times for GPU operations. The layout is structured with each metric having its own section, accompanied by graphs and numerical data.

### Key Elements
- **FPS Section**: Located at the top left, this section shows the current FPS value (60) against a target of 72 and a maximum of 60. It includes a red graph line representing the FPS over time.
- **CPU Section**: Positioned below the FPS section, this area displays the average CPU usage (16.8 ms) along with a target of 13.9 ms and a maximum of 20.58 ms. A blue graph line illustrates the CPU usage over time.
- **GPU Section**: Situated beneath the CPU section, this part shows the average GPU usage (9.7 ms) alongside a target of 13.9 ms and a maximum of 10.03 ms. A purple graph line tracks the GPU usage.
- **Wait for GPU Section**: At the bottom, this section indicates the average wait time for GPU operations (0.4 ms) with a target of 1.0 ms and a maximum of 1.48 ms. A cyan graph line visualizes the wait times.
- **Graphs**: Each metric has a corresponding graph line that fluctuates over time, represented by a series of peaks and troughs.
- **Inspect Button**: Located at the bottom right corner, this button is labeled "Inspect" and likely allows users to delve deeper into specific metrics.
- **Settings Icon**: Found at the top right, this icon suggests the ability to adjust settings related to the performance metrics display.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual elements are the graph lines, which are the focal points of each metric section. The graphs are arranged vertically, with each one corresponding to a specific performance metric. The FPS section is the first to be read, followed by CPU, GPU, and then Wait for GPU. There are no arrows or lines connecting the sections, but the order of presentation implies a logical progression from general performance (FPS) to more specific components (CPU, GPU).
