## Content

### Overview
This image depicts a user interface of a 3D modeling or game development software named "Horizon Worlds - Images & Animation Workshop." The interface includes a central viewport displaying a simple 3D scene with a flat ground plane and a gradient sky. Surrounding the viewport are panels for asset management, hierarchy, and properties.

### Key Elements
- **Viewport**: Located centrally, showing a 3D scene with a flat ground plane and a gradient sky transitioning from light blue at the horizon to a lighter shade above.
- **Hierarchy Panel**: On the left side, labeled "Hierarchy," it contains a single node labeled "SpawnPoint."
- **Assets Panel**: Below the viewport, labeled "Assets," offering options such as "Add New" with choices like "Folder," "3D Model," and "Texture." There are also thumbnail previews of assets like "UIImage," "TransparentImage," "Image," and "FireUIO."
- **Properties Panel**: On the right side, labeled "Properties," currently empty with a placeholder message stating "Select an object to view its properties."
- **Top Bar**: Contains various icons and buttons for navigation, playback, and settings, along with a timestamp indicating the last save time ("All changes saved • 3:54:10 PM").
- **Menu Bar**: At the very top, with options for file operations, view settings, and publishing.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The layout is structured with the viewport as the focal point, flanked by the hierarchy and assets panels on the left and the properties panel on the right. Navigation and playback controls are positioned at the top bar, providing quick access to essential functions.
