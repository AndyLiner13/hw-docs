## Content

### Overview
The image depicts a 3D modeling interface with a character model being manipulated within a grid environment. The interface includes a settings panel and a build panel, both of which are interactive and provide various options for object manipulation and customization.

### Key Elements
- **Character Model**: A cartoonish orange bird wearing sunglasses, standing on a skateboard. The model has a simple design with basic shapes and lacks detailed textures.
- **Settings Panel**: Located on the left side, it contains a menu with options such as "Build," "Comfort," and "Settings." The "Build" option is highlighted.
- **Build Panel**: Positioned on the right, it offers various parameters for building objects, including "Dominant Hand," "Snap to Point," "Grid Unit," "Object Rotation," "Angle," and "Object Manipulation."
- **Grid Environment**: The background features a tiled floor with a grid overlay, indicating a virtual workspace for 3D modeling.
- **Interaction Tools**: Below the build panel, there are icons representing different interaction tools, such as selection, rotation, scaling, and more.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
- **Most Prominent Element**: The character model is the focal point, as it is the subject of the manipulation.
- **Arrows and Lines**: Blue lines form a bounding box around the character model, suggesting that it is being selected or manipulated.
- **Spatial Relationships**: The settings panel is adjacent to the build panel, providing contextual options for the model. The interaction tools are positioned below the build panel, ready for use.
