## Content

### Overview
This image depicts a user interface element, specifically a button with two distinct sections. The overall composition is simple, with a blue background and white text/icons.

### Key Elements
- **Left Section**: A rectangular area with rounded corners, containing the text "delete spawned object". The text is white and centered within the blue rectangle.
- **Right Section**: A circular area with rounded corners, containing the word "object". This section is also blue but has a lighter shade compared to the left section. The text "object" is white and positioned towards the right side of the circle.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual element is the rectangular section on the left due to its larger size and central placement. There is no arrow or line connecting the two sections, suggesting they are separate but related components. The circular section on the right is smaller and positioned to the right of the rectangular section, indicating a secondary action or label associated with the primary action.
