## Content

### Overview
The image displays a user interface element from a software application, specifically a modal window titled "Edit Variable Group." The modal is centered over a larger interface that includes a sidebar menu and a main content area. The modal contains fields for editing a variable group, such as its name and description, along with a toggle switch to add the group to the current world.

### Key Elements
- **Modal Window**: A dark gray modal window with rounded corners, positioned centrally over the main interface.
  - **Title**: "Edit Variable Group"
  - **Description**: "This variable group will allow you to use persistent variables across your worlds and enable cross-world experiences for your worlds."
  - **Name Field**: A text input field containing the text "hh1."
  - **Description Field**: A text input field labeled "Enter Description," currently empty.
  - **Toggle Switch**: A blue toggle switch labeled "Add to this world" with the option "Yes" selected.
  - **Buttons**: Two buttons at the bottom of the modal, "Cancel" and "Submit."

- **Sidebar Menu**: Located on the left side of the image, with a dark background and light text.

    - "Variable Groups" is highlighted, indicating it is the active selection.
  - **Submenu**: Under "Variable Groups," options include "Added To World," "Owned By Me," and "Shared with Me."

- **Main Content Area**: Positioned to the right of the sidebar, partially obscured by the modal window.
  - **Header**: "Variable Groups" with a subtitle "Added To World."
  - **Listed Groups**: Two groups are visible, "hh1" and "hh3," each with a small icon resembling a database and a count of persistent variables associated with them.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
- **Most Prominent Element**: The modal window is the most prominent element due to its central placement and semi-transparent overlay effect.
- **Arrows/Connectors**: No arrows or connectors are present.
- **Spatial Relationships**: The modal window is layered over the sidebar menu and the main content area, creating a layered visual hierarchy. The toggle switch within the modal suggests a choice that affects the visibility of the variable group in the current world.
