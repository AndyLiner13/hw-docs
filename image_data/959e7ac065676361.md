## Content

### Overview
This image depicts a user interface within a game development environment, specifically showing a variable group management screen alongside a 3D scene view. The interface includes a sidebar with a hierarchy of assets, a central panel for managing variable groups, and a properties panel on the right side. The scene view displays a foggy, eerie environment with silhouettes of buildings and a purple sky.

### Key Elements
- **Sidebar (Left Panel)**: Contains a search bar labeled "Search hierarchy," followed by a list of assets such as "SpawnPoint," "MyFirstWorld," "CemeteryMausoleum_geom," "Pedistal," and "ACWpnBattleRifle." The background is dark gray.
- **Central Panel (Variable Groups)**: Displays a section titled "Variable Groups" with a title "Sample." Below it, there is a search bar, a button labeled "Create Variable," and a message stating "Create persistent variables to use across your worlds, then use them in scripts." The background of this panel is dark gray.
- **Scene View (Center)**: Shows a 3D environment with a purple sky, fog, and silhouettes of buildings. There is a green cube icon in the bottom right corner indicating the selection of an object.
- **Properties Panel (Right Panel)**: Currently empty, with a placeholder text "Select an object to view its properties."

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual elements are the sidebar and the central variable group panel. The scene view is secondary but occupies a significant portion of the screen. The properties panel is currently inactive and positioned on the far right. There are no arrows or lines connecting elements, suggesting a linear reading order moving from left to right and then down.
