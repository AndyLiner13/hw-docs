## Content

### Overview
This image displays a version history interface for a file named "Orange chair." It shows two versions of the file, detailing who added them, when they were added, and includes options to view details or restore the older version.

### Key Elements
- **Version**: Version number (2 and 1) displayed in the first column.
- **Added By**: Username "metaeditorcreator" shown next to each version.
- **Date Added**: Timestamps for when each version was added (May 2, 2025 at 8:01 PM and May 2, 2025 at 7:23 PM).
- **Notes**: Empty fields indicating no additional notes are provided.
- **Buttons**: Two buttons labeled "View Details" and "Restore" appear next to the second version.
- **Current Label**: A label "Current" is placed next to version 2, indicating it is the current version.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The interface is structured in a table format. The most prominent elements are the versions listed vertically. There are no arrows or lines connecting elements, but the layout implies a linear progression from older to newer versions. The "Restore" button for version 1 is positioned to the right of its details, suggesting it is an interactive element related to that specific version.
