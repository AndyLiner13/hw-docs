### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual element is the character model, which is the focal point of the scene. The floating interface window provides additional information about the character, while the control joysticks suggest interactive elements for manipulating the character. The smartphone mockup adds a layer of realism, indicating that the character might interact with mobile devices within the game world.
