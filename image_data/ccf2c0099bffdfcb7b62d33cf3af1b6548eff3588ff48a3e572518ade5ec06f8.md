## Content

### Overview
The image depicts a flowchart-style diagram illustrating the structure and interactions within a system, specifically a Progression System that includes components related to scoring, achievements, experience points (XP), and player profiles. The diagram uses rectangles to represent different modules or systems, with arrows indicating the flow of data or events between them.

### Key Elements
- **Scoring System**: Located at the top, represented by a yellow rectangle containing three nested rectangles labeled **ScoreManager**, **StarRating**, and **ComboTracker**. These appear to be sub-modules under the Scoring System.
- **Progression System**: A large blue rectangle spanning the middle and bottom of the diagram, labeled as the main system. It contains several interconnected components.
  - **Achievement System**: A purple rectangle within the Progression System, containing a nested gray rectangle labeled **Achievement Relays** with items like **TilePop**, **Combo**, and **Custom...**.
  - **XP Relay**: A yellow rectangle within the Progression System, labeled **XP Relay** with the note **Listen to Star Events**.
  - **XP Manager**: A pink rectangle within the Progression System, labeled **XP Manager** with items **Award XP** and **Level Up**.
  - **LevelSequenceManager**: A dark gray rectangle within the Progression System, containing items **Objective Configs**, **Board Overrides**, and **XP Overides**.
  - **PlayerProfile**: A green rectangle within the Progression System, labeled **PlayerProfile** with items **Level**, **XP**, and **Thresholds**.
- **Game Events**: A dashed arrow pointing from the Scoring System to the Achievement System, labeled **Game Events**.
- **STAR_RATING_CALCULATED**: A dashed arrow pointing from the Scoring System to the XP Relay, labeled **STAR_RATING_CALCULATED**.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
- The most prominent visual elements are the nested rectangles under the Scoring System and the interconnected components within the Progression System.
- Arrows indicate the flow of data or events, with **Game Events** flowing into the Achievement System and **STAR_RATING_CALCULATED** flowing into the XP Relay.
- Spatial relationships show a hierarchical structure, with the Scoring System as a parent module influencing the Achievement System and the XP Relay through specific events.
