## Content

### Overview
The image depicts a 3D modeling software interface, specifically a scene view within a game development environment. The central focus is a simple 3D model resembling a cube, placed on a grid floor against a gradient sky background. The left side displays a hierarchical list of objects, while the right side shows a properties panel awaiting object selection.

### Key Elements
- **Central Scene**: A white cube model is centered in the scene, positioned on a tiled floor grid. The cube is the focal point of the scene.
- **Background**: A gradient sky transitions from light blue at the horizon to a lighter hue near the viewer, suggesting an outdoor environment.
- **Left Panel**: Contains a hierarchical list of objects, including "Sphere," "Script," "[Environment]," "aaa'______3," "Gravity Cone," "Sphere B," "[Spawn Point]," "Group," "biawhiah," "Cube," and "Sphere."
- **Right Panel**: Displays a properties panel with a placeholder message "Select an object to view its properties." There is also a small icon of a cube with a plus sign, indicating the option to add new objects.
- **Top Bar**: Features various icons and options such as play, transform, local, and publish buttons, along with a search bar labeled "Search hierarchy."

### Visual Flow / Relationships
- **Most Prominent Element**: The white cube model in the center.
- **Spatial Relationships**: The cube is centrally located, with the grid floor beneath it and the gradient sky above. The left panel lists objects hierarchically, and the right panel awaits interaction with the selected object.
