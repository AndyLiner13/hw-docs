## Content

### Overview
The image depicts a user interface of a game development or asset management software. The central area shows a rendered scene with a purple and pink gradient sky, a graveyard setting with tombstones, and a small building resembling a church or mausoleum. On the left side, there is a sidebar with navigation options and a variable group editor. The right side has a properties panel indicating no object is currently selected.

### Key Elements
- **Central Scene**: A rendered view of a graveyard with a church-like building, tombstones, and a fence. The sky features a gradient of purple and pink hues.
- **Left Sidebar**: Contains a hierarchical structure labeled "Hierarchy" with items like "SpawnPoint," "MyFirstWorld," and "ACWpnrBattleRifle." There is also a "Variable Groups" section showing a "Sample" group with options such as "Remove from world," "Sharing permissions," "Edit variable group," and "View details."
- **Top Bar**: Displays menu options like "Build," "Systems," "Preview," "Scripts," and "Gen AI." There are also icons for navigation, search, and publishing.
- **Right Properties Panel**: Currently empty, with a prompt to "Select an object to view its properties."

### Visual Flow / Relationships
- The most prominent visual is the central rendered scene.
- Arrows or lines are not present, but the layout suggests a typical workflow where users navigate through the sidebar to manage assets and view properties in the right panel.
