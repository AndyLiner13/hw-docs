## Content

### Overview
The image depicts a user interface from a 3D modeling software environment. The main focus is on a workspace with a grid background, suggesting a virtual 3D space. There are two panels: one on the left labeled "Build" and another on the right labeled "Assets." A 3D model of a die is highlighted within the Assets panel, surrounded by a blue bounding box. The bottom of the image shows a control panel with various icons, likely for manipulating the 3D model.

### Key Elements
- **Left Panel ("Build")**: Located on the left side of the image. It has a dark background with white text listing categories such as Shapes, Gizmos, Sounds, Assets, My Folders, My Assets, AwesomeStuff, Awesome New Folder, BeholdTriMesh, and Shared With Me. The "Assets" category is highlighted.
- **Right Panel ("Assets")**: Positioned on the right side. It displays a 3D model of a die with a warning icon next to it. The die is gray with red, green, and blue dots. The panel also includes a search icon, a "New" button, and a trash can icon at the top right corner.
- **3D Model**: A die model is centered in the Assets panel, surrounded by a blue bounding box indicating selection or manipulation mode.
- **Control Panel**: At the bottom of the image, there are several icons arranged horizontally, likely for different functions such as selection, transformation, and export options. The time "2:04 PM" is displayed in the bottom center.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual element is the 3D die model in the Assets panel. The "Build" panel on the left provides navigation options for creating and managing assets. The control panel at the bottom offers tools for interacting with the 3D model. The layout suggests a workflow where users can build and manage assets before applying them in the 3D space.
