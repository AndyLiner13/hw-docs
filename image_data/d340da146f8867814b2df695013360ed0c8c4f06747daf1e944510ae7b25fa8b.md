### Overview
The image displays a performance monitoring interface overlaid on a game environment. The interface includes metrics such as FPS and CPU usage, and options for real-time metrics display and trace capture. The game environment in the background features a nighttime setting with a red-roofed building, string lights, and a character control interface.
