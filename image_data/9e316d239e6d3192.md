## Content

### Overview
This image depicts a user interface from a game development or asset management tool. The interface includes a sidebar with a hierarchy of assets, a central preview area showing a 3D environment, and a properties panel on the right side. There is also a floating menu labeled "Variable Groups" displaying persistent variables and collaborators.

### Key Elements
- **Sidebar (Left Panel)**:
  - Contains a tree-like structure with folders and assets labeled as "LOBBY," "[ARENA-CORE]," "BROADSIDE," and others.
  - Includes a search bar labeled "Search hierarchy."
  - Has multiple instances of "Player Assets" under different folders.

- **Central Preview Area**:
  - Shows a 3D environment with a staircase and a corridor.
  - A small pop-up menu appears over the preview area, offering options like "Remove from world" and "View details."

- **Floating Menu ("Variable Groups")**:
  - Displays two variable groups: "SuperPlayer" and "SuperPlayerXFN."
  - Indicates the number of persistent variables and collaborators for each group.
  - Includes a search bar and a plus sign for adding new items.

- **Properties Panel (Right Panel)**:
  - Currently empty, with a placeholder message stating "Select an object to view its properties."

- **Asset Library**:
  - Located at the bottom of the interface, showing a grid of assets with names like "justinsaurus," "packyflyer," "aardonyx," "fire_sword_ass...," and "golden_ruby_d..."

### Visual Flow / Relationships
- The most prominent visual element is the central preview area, which draws attention due to its larger size and the pop-up menu overlaying it.
- The floating "Variable Groups" menu is secondary but important for managing game variables.
- The properties panel is currently inactive, suggesting that no object has been selected for property viewing.
- The asset library at the bottom is a static section, providing access to various assets.
