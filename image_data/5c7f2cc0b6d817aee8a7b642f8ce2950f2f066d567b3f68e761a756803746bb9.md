### Overview
The image depicts a 3D modeling software interface, specifically a scene view within a game engine or similar application. The central area shows a skybox with a gradient blue sky and a tiled floor grid at the bottom. On the left side, there is a hierarchical list of objects, and on the right, there is a properties panel. The interface includes various toolbars and menus at the top.
