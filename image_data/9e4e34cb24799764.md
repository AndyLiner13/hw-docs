## Content

### Overview
This image depicts a user interface element showing two options within a dropdown menu. The main content area explains the functionality of the assistant under the "Code and act" option, while the dropdown menu below offers a choice between "Code only" and "Code and act."

### Key Elements
- **Main Content Area**: Located at the top, this area has a dark background with white text explaining the assistant's capabilities. It states: 
    > The assistant will set up complete gameplay systems by generating scripts, finding and spawning assets, and attaching scripts to objects.
- **Dropdown Menu**: Positioned below the main content area, this menu has a lighter gray background compared to the main content area. It contains two options:
    - **"Code only"**: This option is currently selected, indicated by a downward arrow next to the text. The text reads:
        > The assistant will only generate typescript code snippets.
    - **"Code and act"**: This option is not selected, as indicated by the absence of an arrow next to it. The text reads:
        > The assistant will set up complete gameplay systems by generating scripts, finding and spawning assets, and attaching scripts to objects.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual element is the main content area, which provides an overview of the assistant's capabilities. The dropdown menu is secondary but important for selecting specific modes of operation. There are no arrows or lines connecting elements, so the relationship is purely hierarchical, with the main content area being more prominent than the dropdown menu.
