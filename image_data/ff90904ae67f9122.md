## Content

### Overview
This image depicts a user interface of a programming environment, specifically a block-based scripting interface. The interface is titled "Runtime Manager" and contains a series of interconnected blocks representing code logic. The background is a gradient of blue shades, and the interface itself has a dark theme with colorful blocks for visual differentiation.

### Key Elements
- **Title Bar**: Located at the top, labeled "Runtime Manager." It includes a settings gear icon, a copy icon, and a close (X) icon.
- **Code Blocks**: These are arranged horizontally and vertically, forming a flowchart-like structure. Each block contains text and numbers, indicating variables and operations.
    - **Block 1**: "Spawn asset" followed by "asset at position of self."
    - **Block 2**: "Set # objIdx to # objIdx + # 1."
    - **Block 3**: "When despawnEvent is received with + New Param."
    - **Block 4**: "If length of [ ] objList != # 0."
    - **Block 5**: "Set # objIdx to # 0."
    - **Block 6**: "While # objIdx < length of [ ] objList."
    - **Block 7**: "Delete spawned object get item # objIdx from [ ] objList."
    - **Block 8**: "Set # objIdx to # objIdx + # 1."
    - **Block 9**: "Clear [ ] objList."

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The blocks are arranged in a sequential manner, suggesting a step-by-step process. There are no arrows or lines connecting the blocks, but the vertical stacking implies a logical flow from top to bottom and left to right. The blocks are closely packed together, indicating a compact and efficient layout.
