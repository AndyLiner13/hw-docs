## Content

### Overview
This image depicts a user interface from a software application, specifically a modal dialog box that appears when attempting to delete a Variable Group. The dialog box is centered over the main content area, which displays a list of Variable Groups under the "Variable Groups" tab. The interface has a dark theme with a green accent color.

### Key Elements
- **Modal Dialog Box**: Located centrally, with a dark gray background and rounded corners. Contains a heading, a warning message, and two buttons.
  - **Heading**: "Delete Variable Group?"
  - **Warning Message**: "If you permanently delete this Variable Group, the scripts that reference the persistent variables inside may no longer work properly." Below this message, a pink warning banner states "Variable Group connected to 1 World."
  - **Buttons**: Two buttons labeled "Cancel" and "Delete," both with a gradient pink background and white text.
- **Main Content Area**: Positioned behind the dialog box, showing a list of Variable Groups with icons and names. The highlighted Variable Group is "hh1."
- **Left Sidebar**: Contains navigation options such as "Systems," "Quests," "Leaderboards," "Commerce," and "Variable Groups." The "Variable Groups" option is currently selected, indicated by a blue highlight.
- **Top Right Corner**: A "Create Variable Group" button is visible.
- **Bottom Navigation Bar**: Contains various icons representing different functionalities, such as a cube, wrench, bag, globe, and settings gear.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual element is the modal dialog box, which is designed to capture the user's attention due to its central placement and contrasting color scheme. The warning message and the pink banner draw immediate attention to the potential consequences of deleting the Variable Group. The buttons are clearly differentiated by their color and placement within the dialog box. The main content area remains static but serves as the context for the action being performed. The left sidebar and bottom navigation bar provide additional context and functionality, but they are not directly involved in the current interaction.
