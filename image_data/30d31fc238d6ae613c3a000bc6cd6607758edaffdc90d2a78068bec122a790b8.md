- **Button**: Situated below the spinner control, it has a label "Spinner_CUI" and an icon resembling a person with a badge.
- **Dropdown Menu**: Located at the top left, it appears to be a collapsed dropdown menu with the label "SpinnerDemo:StartTrigger."

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual element is the spinner control due to its central placement and larger size compared to the other elements. The text field is adjacent to the spinner control, and the button is positioned below them. There are no arrows or lines connecting the elements, but the layout suggests a sequential reading order from top to bottom.
