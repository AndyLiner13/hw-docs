## Content

### Overview
This image depicts a user interface screen from a software application, specifically a backup management section. The layout includes a sidebar menu on the left and a main content area on the right. The main content area displays a list of backups with timestamps and options to restore them.

### Key Elements
- **Sidebar Menu**: Located on the left side, it has a dark background with white text. The menu items include "World," "Publish," "Backups," "Players Settings," "Capacity," and "Experimental." "Backups" is highlighted, indicating the current selection.
- **Main Content Area**: On the right, it has a dark background with lighter text. It displays a heading "Backups" followed by a brief description explaining the purpose of backups. Below that, a message indicates the current working version was saved on May 11 at 9:31 AM. A list of backups is shown, each with a timestamp and a "Restore" button next to it.
- **Backup List**: Contains three entries:
  - "test back" created on May 11 at 9:31 AM.
  - "May 11 at 9:08 AM" created from snapshot ID 10159583402923105.
  - "May 11 at 7:06 AM" created from snapshot ID 10159583402923105.
- **Restore Buttons**: Each backup entry has a "Restore" button next to it, which is a dark button with white text.
- **Save Backup Button**: Located at the top right corner, it is a blue button with white text saying "Save Backup."

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual element is the "Restore" button next to the first backup entry. The visual flow follows a linear sequence from the sidebar menu to the main content area, then to the individual backup entries and their respective "Restore" buttons. There are no arrows or lines connecting elements, but the layout implies a sequential reading order moving from left to right and top to bottom.
