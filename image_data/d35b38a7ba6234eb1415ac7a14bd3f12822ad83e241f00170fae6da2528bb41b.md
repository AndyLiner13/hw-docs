## Content

### Overview
This image depicts a 3D modeling software interface, specifically showing a scene with a pie model placed within a virtual environment. The interface includes a sidebar with asset management, a central workspace displaying the 3D model, and a properties panel on the right side.

### Key Elements
- **Sidebar (Left Panel)**: Contains a hierarchical list of assets under categories such as "SpawnPoint," "FxPool," "CoreApi," etc. The "pumpkin_pie" asset is highlighted.
- **Central Workspace**: Displays a 3D model of a pie floating in a virtual environment with a grid floor and a blue arrow indicating rotation axes.
- **Properties Panel (Right Panel)**: Shows various parameters related to the selected asset, including fields like "redTileAssetId," "pumpkin_pie," and others related to tile scaling and rotation.
- **Asset Library**: Located at the bottom left, with tabs for "Asset Library" and "My Assets." The "pumpkin_pie" asset is also shown here with a thumbnail image of the pie.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
