## Content

### Overview
This image depicts a user interface from a game development environment, showing a 3D scene preview alongside various toolbars and panels. The scene preview displays a foggy, eerie landscape with silhouettes of buildings and a graveyard, suggesting a spooky atmosphere. The interface includes multiple tabs and panels for navigation, variable management, and other development tools.

### Key Elements
- **Scene Preview**: A large central area showing a foggy, purple-lit landscape with silhouettes of buildings and a graveyard. The sky has a gradient of purple hues.
- **Variable Groups Panel**: Located on the left side, this panel is titled "Variable Groups." It shows a list with one item labeled "Sample," indicating persistent variables.
- **Hierarchy Panel**: Below the Variable Groups panel, this panel lists project elements such as "SpawnPoint," "MyFirstWorld," "CemeteryMausoleum_geom," "Pedistal," and "ACWpnBattleRifle."
- **Navigation Bar**: At the very top, this bar contains options like "Build," "Systems," "Preview," "Scripts," "Gen AI," "Navigation," and "Quests."
- **Properties Panel**: On the right side, this panel is currently empty, with a prompt to "Select an object to view its properties."

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual is the scene preview, which dominates the central area. The Variable Groups panel is secondary but still noticeable due to its size and content. The Hierarchy panel is positioned below the Variable Groups panel, providing context for the scene being viewed. The Navigation bar at the top serves as a header for the interface, while the Properties panel on the right remains inactive.
