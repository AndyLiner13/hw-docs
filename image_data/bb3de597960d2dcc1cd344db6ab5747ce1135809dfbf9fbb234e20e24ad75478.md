## Content

### Overview
This image depicts a user interface of a digital asset management tool. The layout includes a sidebar menu on the left, a main content area in the center, and a search bar at the top right. The interface has a dark theme with light-colored text and icons.

### Key Elements
- **Sidebar Menu**: Located on the left side, it contains a vertical list of folders and assets labeled as "All Assets." Examples include "My Assets," "Test Sample Rate," and "WAV Audio Samples."
- **Main Content Area**: Positioned centrally, it displays two folder icons labeled "My Folders" and "Shared With Me."
- **Search Bar**: Situated at the top right, it features a magnifying glass icon and the placeholder text "Search All Assets."
- **Tabs**: At the very top, there are tabs labeled "Assets," "Console," and "Tests."

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual element is the sidebar menu due to its larger size and placement on the left. The main content area is secondary but still significant as it shows the actual assets. The search bar is the smallest but highly functional, allowing users to quickly find specific assets. The tabs at the top provide navigation options within the application.
