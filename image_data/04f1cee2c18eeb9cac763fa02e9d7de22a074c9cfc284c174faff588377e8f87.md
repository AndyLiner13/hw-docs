- **Hint Text**: Below the projectile launch, it has a label "hintText" with a corresponding text field containing the text "Fire and use magic."

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The elements are arranged vertically, with each parameter having its own label, field, and toggle switch. The toggle switches are positioned to the right of their respective fields. The "Attach script" button is the only interactive element that stands out due to its larger size and distinct label compared to the other fields.
