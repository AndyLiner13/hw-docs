## Content

### Overview
The image displays a user interface section within a software application, specifically showing properties related to an asset template named "asset_template". The interface includes a notification about overrides that haven't been applied, a toggle for visibility, and options for motion settings.

### Key Elements
- **Notification Box**: Located at the top, highlighted with a red border. Contains a message stating, "This instance has 2 overrides that haven't been applied to the definition." Below the message, there is a clickable link labeled "Review."
- **Toggle Switch**: Positioned below the notification box, to the right of the "Behavior" heading. It is a blue toggle switch indicating the asset is currently visible.
- **Motion Dropdown**: Situated under the "Behavior" section, next to the toggle switch. It shows the current setting as "Animated," with a downward arrow indicating a dropdown menu for more options.
- **Buttons**: At the bottom of the interface, there are two blue buttons labeled "Play" and "Record."

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual elements are the notification box and the toggle switch. The notification box draws attention due to its red border and placement above the toggle switch. The toggle switch is adjacent to the "Behavior" heading, and the motion dropdown is positioned next to it. The buttons at the bottom are less prominent but still noticeable due to their distinct blue color.
