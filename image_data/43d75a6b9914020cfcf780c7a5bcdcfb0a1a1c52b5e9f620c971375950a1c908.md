## Content

### Overview
This image depicts a user interface from a game development environment, likely a scene editor or level designer. The central area shows a grid layout with objects placed within it, and a floating text box providing instructions. On the right side, there is a properties panel displaying various settings related to the selected object.

### Key Elements
- **Central Scene Area**: A grid layout with several objects placed within it. The objects appear to be simple geometric shapes, possibly representing game assets.
- **Floating Text Box**: Located centrally, containing the instruction: > "Find the exit code digits under the objects in the room, and look at the wall to know their order."
- **Properties Panel**: Positioned on the right side, showing properties such as "Visible," "Collidable," "Collision Layer," "Motion," "Animation," "Loop," "Play on Start," "Speed," and "Enable client smoothing." There are also fields for "Position," "Rotation," "Scale," "Tint Color," "Tint Strength," "Brightness," and a "Texture Asset" dropdown.
- **Scene Navigation Controls**: Located at the top left, with options for "Local," "Center," and a rotation angle indicator set to 10°.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual element is the floating text box, which draws attention due to its central placement and larger font size compared to the rest of the interface. The grid layout in the central scene area serves as the backdrop for the objects. The properties panel on the right provides contextual information about the selected object, while the scene navigation controls offer tools for manipulating the view within the scene.
