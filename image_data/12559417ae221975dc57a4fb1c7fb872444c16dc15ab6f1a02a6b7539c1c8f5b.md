## Content

### Overview
This image depicts a 3D modeling software interface, specifically showing a scene with a sphere object placed on a grid floor against a gradient sky background. The interface includes various panels and tools for asset management and scene manipulation.

### Key Elements
- **Scene View**: Located centrally, displaying a 3D environment with a sphere object centered on a grid floor. The sky has a gradient effect transitioning from light blue at the horizon to a darker blue higher up.
- **Sphere Object**: A white sphere is positioned in the center of the scene view.
- **Grid Floor**: A checkered grid pattern covers the floor, indicating the workspace for placing objects.

- **Right Panel**: Displays "Asset details" for an item named "apple song." It includes fields like "Asset ID," "Owner," "Created," and "Modified By," along with a thumbnail image of a purple cube with a white cube inside it.
- **Top Bar**: Features icons for file operations like save, undo, redo, and others, along with a search bar labeled "Search Hierarchy."

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual element is the central scene view. The hierarchy panel on the left and the asset details panel on the right provide contextual information about the scene and its assets.
