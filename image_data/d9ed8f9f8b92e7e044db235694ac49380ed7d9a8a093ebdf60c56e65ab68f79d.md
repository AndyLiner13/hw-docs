## Content

### Overview
This image depicts a user interface from a game development or asset management tool. The main focus is on a section labeled "Variable Groups," which displays a list of variable groups with some options available via a contextual menu. The interface also includes navigation panels, a properties panel, and a preview area showing a 3D model.

### Key Elements
- **Left Panel**: Contains a hierarchical navigation structure with categories like "Hierarchy," "ConstsWorld," "Lobby," and others.
- **Middle Panel**: Displays the "Variable Groups" section with a list of groups such as "Sample," "SuperPlayer," and "SuperPlayerXFN." Each group has a thumbnail icon, persistent variables count, collaborators count, and an option to add to the world.
- **Contextual Menu**: Appears over the "SuperPlayerXFN" group, offering actions like "Remove from world," "Sharing permissions," "Edit variable group," "View details," and "Delete."
- **Right Panel**: Shows a 3D model preview of a building with a "LEADERBOARD" sign visible.
- **Bottom Panel**: Includes tabs for "Tests," "NPC Debugger," and "Performance," along with a search bar for the Asset Library and filters for "Newest" and "Creator."

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual elements are the variable groups listed in the middle panel. The contextual menu is a secondary focus, indicating interaction with the "SuperPlayerXFN" group. The 3D model preview in the right panel serves as a visual representation of assets being managed. The layout follows a typical workflow where users navigate through hierarchies, manage assets, and view previews.
