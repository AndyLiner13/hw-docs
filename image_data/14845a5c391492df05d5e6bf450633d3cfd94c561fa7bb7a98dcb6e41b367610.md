## Content

### Overview
This image depicts a mobile game interface, specifically a match-three puzzle game. The central focus is a grid filled with colorful gemstones arranged in a grid pattern. At the top, there are indicators for the goal, score, moves remaining, and settings.

### Key Elements
- **Grid**: A 7x7 grid filled with various colored gemstones (red, blue, green, purple, orange, pink, and yellow).
- **Gemstones**: Each gemstone has a distinct shape (diamond, triangle, hexagon) and color. They are arranged randomly within the grid.
- **Score**: Located at the top center, displaying "SCORE: 0".
- **Goal**: Positioned at the top left, indicating the goal as "GOAL 5 5 5".
- **Moves Remaining**: At the top right, showing "MOVES 20".
- **Settings Button**: A small gear icon located at the top right next to the moves counter.
- **Navigation Buttons**: At the bottom, there are three buttons labeled with arrows pointing left, right, and up, likely for moving pieces within the grid.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual element is the grid itself, which takes up the majority of the screen space. The score, goal, and moves remaining are secondary but equally important for gameplay. The navigation buttons at the bottom provide interactive control over the game mechanics. There are no arrows or lines connecting elements, suggesting a linear reading order from top to bottom and left to right.
