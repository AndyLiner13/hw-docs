### Overview
The image depicts a 3D environment viewed from behind a character standing on a grid floor. The scene includes a user interface at the bottom with tabs labeled "Asset Library," "Console," "Tests," and "Performance." Below these tabs, there are indicators for simulation view, clear button, and system/user/cloud counts. The console area displays messages related to player interactions with a gizmo.

### Key Elements
- **Character**: A 3D model of a person wearing a black shirt and dark pants, facing away from the viewer.
- **Grid Floor**: A light gray grid covering the entire floor, indicating a virtual space.

    - **Clear Button**: A button labeled "Clear."
    - **Indicators**: Icons with numbers next to them (e.g., "i 2," "A 0," "X 0," "<>" System, <> User, <> Cloud).
    - **Messages**: Console log displaying "[User] OnPlayerEnterAvatarPoseGizmo:" and "[User] OnPlayerExitAvatarPoseGizmo:" entries with timestamps and server information.
- **Background**: A gradient sky transitioning from light blue to white, suggesting an open outdoor environment.
