### Key Elements

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual element is the wooden deck, which draws the viewer's attention as the foreground. The window frame acts as a frame within a frame, directing the eye towards the serene landscape beyond. The horizon line creates a sense of depth and separation between the sky and the distant landforms.
