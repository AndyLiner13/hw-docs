### Overview
This image depicts a user interface element titled "Asset Updates." It shows a screen with two tabs: "Updates (0)" and "Unpublished changes (0)." There is also a button labeled "Update all" on the right side. The central part of the screen displays a circular loading icon and a message stating "No asset updates," indicating that no updates are currently available. The layout suggests a system for managing asset updates within a software application.

### Key Elements

- **Tab 2 ("Unpublished changes (0)")**: Positioned to the right of Tab 1, this tab also indicates zero unpublished changes.
- **"Update all" Button**: Situated on the far right, this button is blue with white text.
- **Circular Loading Icon**: Centrally located beneath the tabs, this icon consists of a circle with a smaller circle inside, both containing diagonal lines suggesting rotation.
- **Message Text**: Below the loading icon, the text reads "No asset updates," followed by a smaller subtitle explaining that updates to assets will show up here as they become available.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual element is the circular loading icon, which draws attention due to its central placement and distinctive design. The tabs are arranged horizontally, with the "Update all" button positioned to the far right.
