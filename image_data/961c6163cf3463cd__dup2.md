## Content

### Overview
This image depicts a user interface from a 3D modeling or game development software. The interface is divided into several panels: Hierarchy, Quests, and Properties. The central area displays a 3D scene with a geodesic dome and a small trailer-like object. The Quests panel contains a search bar, sorting options, and a list of quests. The Properties panel is currently empty, indicating no object is selected for property viewing.

### Key Elements
- **Hierarchy Panel**: Located on the left side, it lists various entities such as SpawnPoint, Group, Sphere, EntityGroup, etc. Each item has a lock icon next to it, suggesting some form of locking or visibility control.
- **Quests Panel**: Positioned at the top center, it includes a search bar, a sort button, and a list of quests. The quest "saddas" is highlighted, showing its name and script ID.
- **Central Scene**: The middle area displays a 3D model of a geodesic dome and a trailer-like object on a green plane with a tiled floor.
- **Properties Panel**: On the right side, it prompts the user to select an object to view its properties but currently shows no selected object.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The interface follows a typical layout for 3D modeling software, with the Hierarchy panel on the left, the central scene in the middle, and the Properties panel on the right. The Quests panel is above the central scene, providing quick access to quest management. The visual flow is linear, moving from the Hierarchy to the central scene and then to the Properties.
