## Content

### Overview
This image depicts a simple 3D coordinate system visualization, likely representing a scene from a physics simulation or a 3D modeling software. The image includes axes and a small sphere at the origin point.

### Key Elements
- **Visual Description**: The image shows a 3D coordinate system with axes represented by colored lines.
- **Location**: 
  - **Green Line**: Positioned vertically, extending upwards from the origin.
  - **Red Line**: Positioned horizontally, extending to the left from the origin.
  - **Blue Line**: Positioned horizontally, extending to the right from the origin.
- **Contents**: 
  - **Origin Point**: A small blue sphere located at the intersection of the red and green lines.
  - **Axes Labels**: None explicitly labeled, but the lines represent the x-axis (red), y-axis (green), and z-axis (blue).
- **Visual Styling**: 
  - **Colors**: Green, red, and blue for the axes.
  - **Line Styles**: Solid lines for the axes.
  - **Sphere**: Small, blue sphere with no additional markings.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
- **Most Prominent Visually**: The axes and the origin point.
- **Spatial Relationships**: The axes form a right-handed coordinate system, with the origin point at the intersection of the axes.
