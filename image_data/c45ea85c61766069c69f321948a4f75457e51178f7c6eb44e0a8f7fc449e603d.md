## Content

### Overview
This image depicts a user interface element, specifically a settings panel within a software application. The panel contains various configurable options related to a VFX controller named "VFXController."

### Key Elements
- **Panel Title**: Located at the top-left corner, the title reads "**VFXController:VFXController**". This is likely the name of the controller being configured.
- **Grabble Entity**: Positioned below the title, this section includes a circular icon labeled "**Gem - Purple**" which seems to represent a selectable entity.
- **ModularSparkleV Gizmo**: Below the grabble entity, there is another circular icon labeled "**ModularSparkleV**". This appears to be another selectable or configurable item.
- **Local Position Fields**: These fields are located below the gizmos and include sliders for adjusting the local position along the X, Y, and Z axes. The current values shown are **X: 0**, **Y: 2**, and **Z: 0**.
- **Play On Start Toggle**: A toggle switch labeled "**playOnStart**" is present, indicating whether the effect should play when the scene starts.
- **Play On Drop Toggle**: Another toggle switch labeled "**playOnDrop**" is positioned below the previous toggle, suggesting similar functionality but for a different event.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The layout is structured vertically with elements grouped logically. The title is the most prominent element, followed by the gizmos, then the position fields, and finally the toggle switches. There are no arrows or lines connecting elements, implying a linear reading order from top to bottom.
