## Content

### Overview
This image depicts a user interface (UI) panel from a software application, likely related to game development or 3D modeling, given the presence of terms like "Raycast," "Mipmap," and "Attached Script." The UI is divided into two main sections: one for visual and interaction settings, and another for attached scripts.

### Key Elements
- **Top Panel (Visual & Interaction):**
  - **Header:** "CustomUI" at the top-left corner.
  - **Tabs:** Three tabs labeled "Visual & Interaction," "Web and Mobile," and "Behavior."
  - **Settings:**
    - **Raycast:** A toggle switch labeled "On" with a green dot indicating it is enabled.
    - **Raycast distance:** A slider set to "3."
    - **Mipmap:** Another toggle switch labeled "On" with a green dot indicating it is enabled.
    - **Mipmap bias:** A slider set to "0.9."

- **Bottom Panel (Attached Script):**
  - **Header:** "Attached Script" at the top-left corner.
  - **Dropdown Menu:** A dropdown menu labeled "Uldemo2:Uldemo2" with a downward arrow indicating it can be expanded.
  - **Script Fields:**
    - **texture:** A field labeled "wallpaper" with a cross icon next to it.
    - **trigger:** A field labeled "<empty>" with a cross icon next to it.
    - **ball:** A field labeled "<empty>" with a cross icon next to it.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The visual hierarchy is clear, with the top panel being more prominent due to its larger size and the placement of the "Raycast" toggle switch. The bottom panel is less prominent but still important as it contains script fields that can be interacted with. There are no arrows or lines connecting elements, so the relationship is primarily through the layout and the user's interaction with the UI.
