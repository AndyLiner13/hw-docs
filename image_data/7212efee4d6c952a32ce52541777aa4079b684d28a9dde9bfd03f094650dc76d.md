- **Shape Labels**: Positioned directly below each shape preview, providing names such as "SmoothCylinder," "HalfTube," "Cone," etc.
- **Shape Previews**: Square tiles containing 3D models of shapes. Each tile has a gradient background transitioning from light blue to white.
- **Shape Labels**: Positioned directly below each shape preview, providing names such as "SmoothCylinder," "HalfTube," "Cone," etc.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual element is the search bar at the top. Below it, the shapes are arranged in a grid layout, with each shape having its own tile. The tiles are arranged in rows and columns, creating a clear and organized visual flow. There are no arrows or lines connecting the elements, but the arrangement suggests a logical reading order from left to right and then down to the next row.
