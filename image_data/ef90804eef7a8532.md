## Content

### Overview
This image depicts a user interface for a scripting or programming environment, specifically a block-based code editor. The interface is divided into multiple sections, each containing blocks that represent different commands or actions within a script. The background is a gradient of blue shades, and the main interface has a dark theme with light-colored text and blocks.

### Key Elements
- **Title Bar**: Located at the top, labeled "Runtime Manager." It includes icons for settings, copy, and close functions.
- **Code Blocks**: These are arranged vertically and horizontally, forming a flowchart-like structure. Each block contains text and icons representing specific actions or conditions.
    - **Block 1**: "when objSpawned is received with obj"
    - **Block 2**: "add obj to [ ] objList"
    - **Block 3**: "when spawnEvent is received with + New Param"
    - **Block 4**: "if length of [ ] objList == #0"
    - **Block 5**: "set # objIdx to #0"
    - **Block 6**: "while # objIdx < # numObj"
    - **Block 7**: "Spawn asset at position of self + [0 0 1] * # objIdx using #0"
    - **Block 8**: "set # objIdx to # objIdx + #1"
    - **Block 9**: "when despawnEvent is received with + New Param"

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The blocks are arranged in a sequential manner, indicating a step-by-step process. There are no arrows or lines connecting the blocks, but the vertical stacking suggests a chronological order. The blocks are aligned to the left, with some blocks extending horizontally to show nested conditions or actions.
