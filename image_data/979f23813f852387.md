## Content

### Overview
This image depicts a 3D modeling interface with a grid workspace in the center, a shape selection panel on the left, and property settings on the right. The interface appears to be part of a game development or 3D modeling software.

### Key Elements
- **Shape Selection Panel**: Located on the left side, it displays various geometric shapes such as cube, sphere, cone, cylinder, ramp, pyramid, tube, half-cylinder, half-tube, faceted-cylinder, capsule, torus, half-torus, half-sphere, and cube-soft. The sphere shape is highlighted with a red bounding box.
- **Workspace**: The central area is a 3D grid workspace where a white sphere model is placed at coordinates (0.5, 0.67, 2.51).
- **Properties Panel**: On the right side, it shows properties of the selected sphere, including behavior, attributes, physics, and script settings. The sphere is marked as visible and collidable, with specific rotation and scale values provided.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual element is the sphere in the workspace. The shape selection panel is secondary but crucial for creating new objects. The properties panel is tertiary, providing detailed information about the selected object. There are no arrows or lines connecting elements, suggesting a linear reading order from left to right.
