## Content

### Overview
The image depicts a circular flowchart or cycle diagram illustrating a core loop process. It consists of three main stages connected by arrows forming a continuous loop. The diagram is labeled as "Example Core Loop."

### Key Elements
- **Motivation**: Located at the top-left of the circle, connected by a green arrow pointing clockwise. Contains text: > *"complete level, collect cosmetic, collect coins, etc"*.
- **Action**: Positioned at the top-right of the circle, also connected by a green arrow. Contains text: > *"Play level, complete challenge, finish puzzle, defeat enemies, etc"*.
- **Reward**: Situated at the bottom of the circle, connected by a green arrow. Contains text: > *"Currencies, cosmetics, level up, progress on path, etc"*.
- **Circular Path**: A large dark green circle forms the boundary of the loop, with smaller green arrows indicating the direction of movement within the cycle.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
- **Most Prominent Element**: The central label "Example Core Loop" is the focal point.
- **Arrows**: Green arrows connect the three stages, forming a clear directional flow from Motivation to Action to Reward back to Motivation.
- **Spatial Relationships**: The stages are evenly spaced around the circle, with each stage connected to the next by a green arrow, creating a continuous loop.
