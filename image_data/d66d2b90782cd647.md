## Content

### Overview
The image depicts a digital interface, likely from a software application designed for creating or editing 3D environments. The central part of the interface displays a rendered scene featuring a night sky with auroras, snow-capped mountains, and a distant horizon. On the right side, there is a chat-like interaction area showing generated images related to the described scene. The bottom section contains asset management tools, including folders and preview thumbnails of various assets.

### Key Elements
- **Central Scene**: A vibrant night sky filled with auroras in shades of purple and pink, transitioning into a gradient of orange and red near the horizon. Snow-covered mountain peaks are prominently displayed at the base of the sky.
- **Right Panel**: Contains a chat-style interaction area with two instances of generated images labeled "Horizon AI." These images show variations of the described scene, with one featuring a road leading towards the aurora and another showing a more detailed view of the mountains.
- **Bottom Section**: Displays an asset management interface with tabs labeled "Assets," "Console," and "Tests." Below these tabs, there is a folder named "My Assets" containing several thumbnail previews of different skybox assets, labeled with names like "generated_skybox_..." and "jee_test_skybox."

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual element is the central scene, which draws attention due to its vivid colors and dynamic nature. The chat-like interaction area on the right provides context for the generated images, suggesting that users can interact with the AI to refine or generate new scenes. The bottom section serves as a toolset for managing assets, indicating that the user can add, search, and organize resources relevant to the scene being viewed.
