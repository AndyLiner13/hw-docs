## Content

### Overview
This image depicts a user interface from a game development or asset management tool. The interface includes a sidebar with a hierarchy of assets, a central workspace displaying a 3D model, and a panel showing variable groups. There are also various toolbars and menus at the top.

### Key Elements
- **Sidebar (Left Panel)**: Contains a tree-like structure labeled "Hierarchy," listing various folders and assets under categories like "ConstsWorld," "[ARENA-CORE]," and "[Asset] OGF-Mega Asset." The folder "Player Assets" is expanded multiple times.
- **Central Workspace**: Displays a 3D model of a building or structure with a light brown and beige color scheme. A small pop-up window is partially covering part of the model.
- **Variable Groups Panel**: Located above the central workspace, showing two variable groups named "SuperPlayer" and "SuperPlayerXFN." Each group has a red icon, a name, a count of persistent variables, and collaborators.
- **Pop-up Window**: Appears over the 3D model, offering options such as "Remove from world" and "View details."
- **Bottom Panel**: Contains tabs labeled "Tests," "NPC Debugger," and "Performance." Below these tabs, there is a search bar for the Asset Library and filters for sorting assets by newest, creator, and other criteria.
- **Properties Panel (Right Panel)**: Currently empty, with a placeholder message stating "Select an object to view its properties."

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The layout follows a typical workflow in a game development environment. The sidebar provides navigation, the central workspace displays the current project, and the Variable Groups panel allows for managing game variables. The pop-up window suggests interactive functionality within the workspace. The Properties panel is designed to display information about selected objects but currently lacks content.
