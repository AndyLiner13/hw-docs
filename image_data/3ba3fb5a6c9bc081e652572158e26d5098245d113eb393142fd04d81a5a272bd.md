## Content

### Overview
The image displays a web interface for managing items within a virtual world platform called Meta Horizon. It shows a list of items available for distribution across multiple worlds. The layout includes navigation panels on the left, a main content area in the center, and various interactive elements such as buttons and dropdown menus.

### Key Elements
- **Navigation Panel**: Located on the left side, it contains expandable sections labeled "Worlds," "Assets," "Item inventory," "Creator program," "Payout," and "Performance." Each section has a corresponding icon next to its title.
- **Main Content Area**: Positioned centrally, it displays a table titled "Item inventory." The table headers include "Category," "Status," "Can be acquired in," "Price," "Updated," and "Listing link."
- **Table Data**: Rows in the table list items like "Two Smiles Top," "Space Armour Top," "X-ray Top," "Vinyl Boots Shoes," "Chef's Jacket," "Speed Shorts," and "Bauhaus Tshirt." Each row contains an icon representing the item, a checkbox, and details such as status ("Published," "Ready to list"), price, acquisition location, update date, and a "Copy listing link" button.
- **Interactive Elements**: Buttons like "Copy Storefront link," "View item sales," and "Create avatar item" are located at the top right. A search bar is also present above the table.
- **Pagination**: At the bottom of the table, pagination controls indicate that this is page 1 of 100 items.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual element is the central table, which organizes the items in a grid-like structure. The interactive buttons and search bar are secondary but important for navigation and functionality. The left navigation panel allows users to switch between different sections of the platform.
