## Content

### Overview
The image displays a user interface section within a software application, specifically showing properties related to an asset template. The interface includes a notification about overrides that haven't been applied, along with toggles and dropdown menus for behavior settings.

### Key Elements
- **Notification Box**: Located at the top, highlighted with a red border. Contains a message stating, *"This instance has 2 overrides that haven't been applied to the definition"* with a clickable "Review" link.
- **Debug Data Section**: Below the notification, a section labeled "Debug Data" with a small arrow indicating expandable content.
- **Behavior Toggle**: A toggle switch labeled "Visible" with a blue indicator, located under the "Debug Data" section.
- **Motion Dropdown**: A dropdown menu labeled "Motion" with the option "Animated" selected, situated below the "Behavior" section.
- **Play and Record Buttons**: Two blue buttons labeled "Play" and "Record" at the bottom right corner.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual element is the notification box due to its size and red border. The elements are arranged vertically, with the notification at the top, followed by the debug data section, then the behavior toggle, motion dropdown, and finally the play and record buttons at the bottom. There are no arrows or lines connecting the elements, but the layout suggests a sequential reading order from top to bottom.
