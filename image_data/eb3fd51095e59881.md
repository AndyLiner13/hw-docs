## Content

### Overview
This image depicts a user interface screen from a game development tool, specifically showing the Leaderboards section under the Systems menu. The layout includes a sidebar with menu options and a main content area displaying leaderboard information.

### Key Elements
- **Sidebar Menu**: Located on the left side, with a dark background and white text. Contains four menu items: Systems, Quests, Leaderboards, Player Variables, and Variable Groups. The "Leaderboards" option is highlighted with a purple underline.
- **Main Content Area**: Positioned on the right, with a dark background and white text. Displays the title "Leaderboards" at the top. Below that, it shows "World Leaderboards (2/3)" indicating the current progress out of three worlds. There are two leaderboard entries listed: "leaderboard1" marked as "Daily" and "leaderboard2" marked as "Never resets." Each entry has a small trophy icon next to it. To the right of the leaderboards, there is a "Create Leaderboard" button in a purple rectangle, and a dropdown menu labeled "A-Z" for sorting.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual elements are the sidebar menu and the main content area. The sidebar is static and serves as a navigation tool, while the main content area dynamically displays leaderboard information. The footer bar at the bottom provides quick access to various tools and settings. Arrows or lines connecting elements are not present, but the layout suggests a linear reading order moving from left to right and then down the page.
