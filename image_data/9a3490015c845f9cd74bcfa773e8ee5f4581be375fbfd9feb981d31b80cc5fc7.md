## Content

### Overview
The image depicts a diagram illustrating a server-client interaction flow involving TypeScript Runtime, CustomUIStateService, ReactVR, and Redux store components. The diagram uses arrows to indicate the direction of data flow between the server and client.

### Key Elements
- **Server Section**:
  - **Visual description**: A brown rectangular box labeled "Server" at the top.
  - **Location**: Top section of the image.
  - **Contents**: Contains two smaller rectangles within the brown box labeled "TypeScript Runtime" and "CustomUIStateService".
  - **Visual styling**: Dark teal background with white text, bordered edges.

- **Client Section**:
  - **Visual description**: A green rectangular box labeled "Client" at the bottom.
  - **Location**: Bottom section of the image.
  - **Contents**: Contains two smaller rectangles within the green box labeled "ReactVR (Redux store, Custom UI DOM)" and "CustomUIStateService".
  - **Visual styling**: Dark teal background with white text, bordered edges.

- **Arrows**:
  - **Network RPC**: A downward arrow pointing from the server to the client.
  - **initialize()**: A downward arrow pointing from the server to the client.
  - **Binding.set()**: A downward arrow pointing from the server to the client.
  - **Callback**: An upward arrow pointing from the client back to the server.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
- **Most prominent visually**: The server and client sections are the most prominent due to their larger size and central placement.
- **Arrows indicate**: The direction of data flow between the server and client.
- **Spatial relationships**: The server section is above the client section, indicating that the server initiates communication. Arrows show the sequence of actions: network RPC, initialize(), Binding.set(), and then a callback from the client to the server.
