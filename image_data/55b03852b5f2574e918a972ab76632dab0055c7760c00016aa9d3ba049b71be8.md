### Overview
This image depicts a user interface of an asset library, likely within a digital asset management tool or game development software. The interface includes a search bar, filtering options, and a grid of assets displayed below.

### Key Elements
- **Search Bar**: Located at the top right, contains a magnifying glass icon and the word "apple," indicating a search term has been entered.
- **Filter Options**: Positioned next to the search bar, offering sorting criteria such as "Highest rated" and a dropdown menu for selecting filters.
- **Tabs**: At the very top, there are tabs labeled "Asset Library," "Console," "Tests," and "Performance."
- **Navigation Menu**: On the left side, there are two sections: "Public Assets" and "My Assets," both with lock icons suggesting restricted access.
- **Asset Grid**: Below the navigation menu, there are five assets displayed in a grid layout. Each asset has a thumbnail image, a name, and a creator's name.
    - **Asset 1**: A white tree with a lock icon, labeled "Apple Tree W..." under "MetaHorizon..."
    - **Asset 2**: A brown tree with a lock icon, labeled "Apple Tree AU..." under "MetaHorizon..."
    - **Asset 3**: A green tree with a lock icon, labeled "Apple Tree" under "MetaHorizon..."
    - **Asset 4**: A yellowish-brown rotten apple with a lock icon, labeled "Apple Rotten" under "MetaHorizon..."
    - **Asset 5**: A red apple with a lock icon, labeled "Apple" under "MetaHorizon..."
    - **Asset 6**: A red apple without a lock icon, labeled "Red Apple" under "Ivanchuhov."

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual elements are the search bar and the asset grid. The assets are arranged in a grid format, with thumbnails, names, and creators' names clearly visible. There are no arrows or lines connecting elements, but the layout suggests a logical reading order moving from left to right and then down the rows.
