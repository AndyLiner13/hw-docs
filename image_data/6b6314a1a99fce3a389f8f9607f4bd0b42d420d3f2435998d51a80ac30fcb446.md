## Content

### Overview
This image depicts a user interface from a 3D modeling or game development software. The main focus is on a 3D cube model displayed in a viewport, with various tools and settings above it. The interface includes tabs for different functionalities such as "Trigger Zone," "Avatars," "Media," "Effects," and "Environment."

### Key Elements
- **Top Bar**: Contains multiple icons and tabs. The "Trigger Zone" tab is highlighted, indicating it is currently active. The icons include a target, a wrench, a play button, and others that likely represent different functions within the software.
- **Viewport**: Shows a 3D cube model with a grid background. The cube has a blue outline and green faces, suggesting it can be manipulated in 3D space.
- **Settings Panel**: Located below the top bar, it includes fields for "# 1," "10°," and "10%." These likely represent parameters related to the current selection or object being edited.
- **Cube Model**: A transparent cube with a blue outline is centered in the viewport. It has a red dot at its center, possibly indicating the origin point or a specific point of interest within the cube.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual element is the 3D cube model in the viewport. The interface is structured with a clear top bar for navigation and a settings panel for parameter adjustments. The cube model is centrally located, drawing attention to its geometry and orientation.
