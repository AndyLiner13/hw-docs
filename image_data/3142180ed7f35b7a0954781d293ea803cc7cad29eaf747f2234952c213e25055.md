## Content

### Overview
This image depicts a user interface from a material editor, likely within a 3D modeling software. The interface includes a sidebar with various icons representing different tools and settings, and a central area displaying material properties and node settings.

### Key Elements
- **Sidebar Icons**: Located on the left side, these icons represent different functions such as layers, materials, and other editing tools. They are small, square, and have distinct symbols.
- **Material Name**: "Material.001" is displayed prominently at the top of the interface.
- **Material Editor Panel**: This panel is divided into sections. The top part shows the material name and a plus sign for adding new materials. Below that, there are expandable sections labeled "Image," "Surface," and others.
- **Surface Section**: Contains parameters like "Base Color," "Metallic," "Roughness," "IOR," "Alpha," and "Normal." Each parameter has a corresponding slider or input field.
- **Use Nodes Button**: A blue button labeled "Use Nodes" is located below the surface parameters.
- **Expandable Sections**: These include "Subsurface," "Specular," "Transmission," "Coat," "Sheen," and "Emission," which can be expanded to reveal more settings.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The interface follows a vertical layout with the sidebar on the left and the main content area on the right. The expandable sections are nested under the "Surface" heading. The "Use Nodes" button is positioned below the surface parameters, making it a secondary focus after the surface settings.
