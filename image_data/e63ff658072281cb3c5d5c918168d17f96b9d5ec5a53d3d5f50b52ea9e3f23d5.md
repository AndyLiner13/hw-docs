## Content

### Overview
This image depicts a 3D modeling environment interface, likely from a game development tool. It shows a 3D object being manipulated within a grid-based workspace. The right side of the screen displays a settings panel for the object, labeled "GameplayTags."

### Key Elements
- **3D Object**: A transparent cube with a blue outline, placed on a yellow base. Inside the cube, there is a smaller object resembling a loot box with an orange exterior and a white interior. The object has a red arrow pointing towards it, indicating some form of interaction or selection.
- **Grid Workspace**: The object is situated on a light gray grid, suggesting a 3D modeling environment.
- **Settings Panel**: Located on the right side, it includes various parameters such as "active," "mesh," "pfx," "light," and numerical values for "animRotationFrequency," "animBobFrequency," "animBobAmplitude," "lootSKU," "lootCount," "respawnEnabled," and "respawnDelay." There is also a toggle switch next to "respawnEnabled."
- **Tag Input Box**: At the top of the settings panel, there is a search bar labeled "Search attached tags."
- **Tree Structure**: Below the tag input box, there is a tree structure showing the object's hierarchy, starting with "SimpleLootItem:SimpleLoot..." and expanding into more specific parameters.
- **Attach Script Button**: At the bottom of the settings panel, there is a blue button labeled "Attach script."

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual element is the 3D object in the center-left. The settings panel on the right provides contextual information about the object. The grid workspace serves as the backdrop for the 3D object. The red arrow on the object suggests an interactive element, possibly highlighting a feature or action point. The settings panel is organized hierarchically, with the tree structure indicating nested parameters related to the object.
