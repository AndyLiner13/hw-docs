## Content

### Overview
This image depicts a 3D modeling software interface, specifically showing a scene with a cube object placed in a virtual environment. The interface includes a hierarchy panel, a central viewport displaying the 3D scene, and a properties panel on the right side.

### Key Elements
- **Hierarchy Panel**: Located on the left side, it lists various objects in the scene, such as "Sphere," "Script1," "[Environment]," and others. The "Cube" object is highlighted in blue, indicating selection.
- **Viewport**: The central area displays a 3D scene with a gradient sky background transitioning from light blue at the horizon to darker blue higher up. A white cube is centered in the scene, outlined in blue, suggesting it is selected or active.
- **Properties Panel**: Positioned on the right, it contains detailed information about the selected "Cube" object. It includes sections for "Behavior," "Attributes," "Gameplay Tags," "Physics," and "More." The "Behavior" section has toggles for visibility, light & shadow, collidable status, and collision layer settings. The "Attributes" section shows the cube's position, rotation, scale, texture, material roughness, color, and gameplay tags. The "Physics" section indicates no physics audio material assigned, and the "More" section specifies that the object can be grabbed by anyone.
- **Grid Floor**: At the bottom of the viewport, a grid floor is visible, likely representing the workspace for placing and manipulating objects.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual element is the white cube in the center of the viewport. The hierarchy panel on the left highlights the selected object, while the properties panel on the right provides detailed information about the selected object. The grid floor at the bottom anchors the scene within the workspace.

### Color Palette
- **Primary background**: #E0F2FD (light blue gradient)
- **Secondary background**: #FFFFFF (white for the cube outline and grid floor)
- **Text colors**: #FFFFFF (white for the hierarchy and properties panels)
- **Accent colors**: #007ACC (blue for the selected object in the hierarchy panel and the properties panel header)
- **Borders/Dividers**: #000000 (black for the grid floor and some panel borders)

### Typography
- **Heading style**: Sans-serif font, bold, approximately 14px
- **Body text style**: Sans-serif font, regular, approximately 12px
- **Other text styles**: No other distinctly different text styles noted.

### Spacing & Layout
- **Padding**: ~8px padding around the hierarchy panel and properties panel
- **Margins**: ~16px margin between the hierarchy panel and the viewport, and between the viewport and the properties panel
- **Element alignment**: The hierarchy panel is aligned to the left, the viewport is centered, and the properties panel is aligned to the right. The grid floor is aligned to the bottom of the viewport.

### Interactive Elements Details
- **Selected Object**: The white cube with a blue outline is the interactive element. Its visual state shows it as selected, indicated by the blue outline.
- **Hierarchy Panel**: The "Cube" object is highlighted in blue, indicating it is selected. There are no interactive elements within the hierarchy panel itself.

### Visual Indicators
- **Icons**: None visible in the image.
- **Borders**: Black solid borders are used for the grid floor and some panel edges.
- **Shadows**: None visible.
- **Highlights/Emphasis**: Blue highlight for the selected object in the hierarchy panel and the properties panel header.
- **Separators**: Horizontal lines separate different sections within the properties panel.
