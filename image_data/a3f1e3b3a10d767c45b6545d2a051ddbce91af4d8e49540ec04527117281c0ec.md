## Content

### Overview
This image depicts a modal dialog box titled "Report asset." It contains fields for reporting an asset issue within a virtual experience platform called Horizon Worlds. The dialog includes a dropdown menu for selecting the type of violation, a text area for providing additional details, and a warning message at the bottom.

### Key Elements
- **Title**: "Report asset" located at the top-left corner.
- **Message**: "You are reporting the Wood Ball asset. Let us know what's wrong with it so that we can review it." Positioned centrally above the form fields.
- **Dropdown Menu**: Labeled "Type of violation (required)" with a placeholder text "Select" and a downward-pointing arrow indicating a dropdown interface.
- **Text Area**: Labeled "Description (required)" with a placeholder text "Provide additional details on what is wrong with the asset you are reporting." Positioned below the dropdown menu.
- **Warning Message**: A rectangular box with a light gray background and a darker gray border, containing the text "> Please read the Code of Conduct for Virtual Experiences so we keep Horizon Worlds fun and safe. Learn more" with a clickable link labeled "Learn more."
- **Buttons**: Two buttons labeled "Cancel" and "Report asset" at the bottom, with the "Report asset" button highlighted in blue.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual element is the title at the top. The form fields follow a logical sequence starting from the dropdown menu, then the text area, and finally the warning message and buttons at the bottom. There are no arrows or lines connecting elements, but the layout suggests a linear reading order moving from top to bottom.
