## Content

### Overview
This image depicts a user interface element within a virtual environment, specifically a pop-up window titled "Import Data." The window is centered over a blurred background that appears to be part of a game or simulation setting. The pop-up contains options for importing data into a world, with checkboxes for selecting specific types of variables. There are two buttons at the bottom of the pop-up: "Cancel" and "Start Import."

### Key Elements
- **Pop-up Window**: A white rectangular box with rounded corners, positioned centrally over the background.
  - **Title**: "Import Data"
  - **Content**: Contains three checkboxes labeled "Quests," "Persistent Variables," and "Leaderboards," each with a note underneath explaining the import process.
  - **Buttons**: Two buttons at the bottom, "Cancel" and "Start Import," both with a white background and black text.
- **Background**: Blurred, showing a virtual environment with a character model, floating objects, and a chat interface on the right side.
- **Chat Interface**: Located on the right side of the image, partially obscured by the pop-up. It includes user profiles and chat messages.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The pop-up is the most prominent visual element, drawing attention due to its central placement and contrasting white color against the darker background. The "Start Import" button is slightly more prominent than the "Cancel" button due to its larger size and red background. The chat interface on the right provides contextual information about the virtual environment but does not interact with the pop-up.
