## Content

### Overview
This image depicts a 3D modeling software interface, specifically showing a scene within a game development environment. The central area displays a 3D model of a trailer and a geodesic dome structure against a blue sky backdrop. The left side features a hierarchical structure labeled "Hierarchy," listing various entities such as "SpawnPoint," "Group," "[EntityGroup]," and others. The right side contains a "Properties" panel that currently prompts the user to select an object to view its properties. The top section includes a "Quests" panel with a search bar and a list of quests, one of which is highlighted as "Debug Quests."

### Key Elements
- **Scene Area**: Center of the image shows a 3D model of a trailer and a geodesic dome. The trailer has a white body with a brown roof and a small wooden crate on top. The dome is a white, geometric structure resembling a geodesic dome.
- **Hierarchy Panel**: Left side, dark gray background with white text. Lists entities like "SpawnPoint," "Group," "[EntityGroup]," etc., with some entities marked as "[EntityGroup]" in brackets.
- **Quests Panel**: Top middle, also dark gray with white text. Contains a search bar, a list of quests under "World Quests," and a highlighted quest named "Debug Quests."
- **Properties Panel**: Right side, dark gray with white text. Displays a prompt to "Select an object to view its properties."
- **Background**: A gradient blue sky, suggesting an outdoor environment.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The visual hierarchy is clear with the scene in the center, the hierarchy on the left, and the quests and properties panels at the top and right respectively. There are no arrows or lines connecting elements, but the layout suggests a typical workflow where users interact with the hierarchy first, then view the scene, and finally adjust properties.
