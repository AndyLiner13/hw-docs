## Content

### Overview
This image depicts a user interface within a game development environment, specifically showing a scene preview and a side panel with a leaderboard feature. The scene preview displays a foggy, eerie graveyard at dusk, with silhouettes of tombstones and a mausoleum. The leaderboard panel is open, showing a single entry labeled "Sample" with a note that it "Never resets."

### Key Elements
- **Scene Preview**: Located centrally, showing a graveyard scene with a purple and pink gradient sky, fog, and silhouettes of tombstones and a mausoleum.
- **Leaderboard Panel**: Positioned on the left side, with a dark background and light text. Contains a search bar, a plus sign for adding new leaderboards, and a "Sort" button. The leaderboard itself shows one entry labeled "Sample," with a trophy icon next to it and a note stating "Never resets."
- **Navigation Panel**: On the far left, with a dark background and light text, listing items such as "SpawnPoint," "MyFirstWorld," "CemeteryMausoleum_geom," "Pedistal," and "ACWpnBattleRifle."
- **Properties Panel**: On the right side, currently empty, indicating no object is selected for property viewing.
- **UI Elements**: Various UI elements such as tabs ("Navigation," "Quests," "Variable Groups"), a play button, and a publish button are visible at the top.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual is the scene preview, which dominates the central area. The leaderboard panel is secondary but still noticeable due to its size and content. The navigation panel on the left provides context for the scene being viewed. The properties panel on the right is currently inactive, suggesting the focus is on the scene and leaderboard.
