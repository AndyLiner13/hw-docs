### Overview
The image displays a user interface for managing leaderboards within a game development tool. The main focus is on the "Edit Leaderboard" modal window, which allows users to configure various settings for a leaderboard. The interface includes a sidebar menu on the left, a world leaderboard section in the middle, and a floating action button at the top right for creating new leaderboards.

### Key Elements

- **World Leaderboard Section**: Positioned centrally, showing a world leaderboard titled "World Leaderboard" with a subtitle "Define world-specific leaderboards." Two leaderboard entries are visible, each with a trophy icon and a daily reset frequency indicator.
- **Edit Leaderboard Modal**: A floating window in the center-right area of the screen. It contains fields for editing a leaderboard, including "Name," "Sort Order," "Reset frequency," and an option to "Reset persistent variable (optional)." There are also buttons for "Cancel" and "Save."
