### Overview
This image depicts a user interface element within a software application, specifically a tooltip or contextual menu that appears when hovering over a button labeled "AI Speech." The interface includes tabs at the top for navigating different sections of the application.

### Key Elements
- **Top Navigation Tabs**: Located at the very top, these tabs include "Asset Library," "Console," "Tests," and "NPC Debugger." Each tab has a dark background with white text.

- **AI Speech Toggle**: A toggle switch labeled "AI Speech" with a white background and a dark gray toggle handle.
- **Search Bar**: A search bar with a magnifying glass icon, located to the right of the toggle switch. The search bar has a dark background with white text.
- **Tooltip**: A black rectangular box with rounded corners appears below the "AI Speech" toggle. It contains text explaining the functionality of enabling/disabling NPC AI speech while testing in the Editor. The text is white and readable against the black background.
- **Additional Text**: Below the tooltip, there is a smaller line of text that says "Hold ctrl to learn more."

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual element is the tooltip, which draws attention due to its placement directly beneath the "AI Speech" toggle. The flow of interaction likely follows the user's mouse movement, starting from the "AI Speech" toggle and moving downward to the tooltip for additional information. The navigation tabs at the top provide context for the user's current location within the application.
