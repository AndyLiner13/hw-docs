## Content

### Overview
This image depicts a user interface element showing asset details for a broadcast titled "Simple World Broadcast." The interface includes a title bar, a text input field, and a description area.

### Key Elements
- **Title Bar**: Located at the top, spans the width of the interface. Contains the text "Asset details" and a back arrow icon on the left side.
- **Text Input Field**: Positioned below the title bar, it has a placeholder text "Simple World Broadcast" and a counter indicating "22/40" characters remaining.
- **Icon**: A small icon resembling a gear or settings symbol is placed next to the text input field.
- **Main Content Area**: A large rectangular section occupies the majority of the screen, featuring a gradient background transitioning from dark gray to light gray. Within this area, there is a white outline of a cube.
- **Description Text**: At the bottom, there is a block of text describing the asset as "A version of World Broadcast which only has a controller (World Broadcast Brain) and an entity which can act as a 'camera position'."

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual element is the title bar at the top. The text input field is secondary but important for interaction. The main content area with the cube icon is central and draws attention due to its larger size and distinct shape. The description text at the bottom provides additional context without being overly prominent.
