## Content

### Overview
The image depicts a simple geometric representation of a coordinate system. It includes three axes labeled X, Y, and Z, each represented by a directional arrow.

### Key Elements
- **X-axis**: A red arrow pointing right, labeled 'X' in red.
- **Y-axis**: A green arrow pointing upwards, labeled 'Y' in green.
- **Z-axis**: A blue arrow pointing diagonally towards the upper right, labeled 'Z' in blue.
- **Origin**: A black dot at the intersection of the X, Y, and Z axes.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
- The most prominent visual elements are the arrows representing the axes.
- There are no arrows connecting the axes, but the arrangement implies a relationship where the axes intersect at a single point.
- The spatial relationship is linear, with the axes extending outward from the origin.
