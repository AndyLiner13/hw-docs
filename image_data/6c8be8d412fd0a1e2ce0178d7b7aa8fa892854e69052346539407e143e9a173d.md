## Content

### Overview
This image is a floor plan or layout diagram showing a room with labeled areas and annotations indicating visibility conditions. The diagram includes shapes representing objects or areas within the room, with text annotations explaining visibility settings.

### Key Elements
- **Room Layout**: A rectangular room with walls marked by black lines forming a grid-like structure.
- **Green Pentagons**: These are placed within the room, likely representing objects or areas that are visible when "Visibility On."
- **Red Hexagon and Pentagon**: These are placed outside the room, likely representing objects or areas that are not visible ("Visibility Off").
- **Annotations**: Text labels such as "Visibility On" and "Visibility Off" are placed near the respective areas.
- **Arrows and Lines**: An orange arrow points from the green pentagons towards the red hexagon, indicating a line of sight issue.
- **Text Annotations**: "No line of sight to second room" is written above the orange arrow, explaining the visual relationship between the two areas.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual elements are the green pentagons and the red hexagon. The orange arrow and accompanying text highlight the lack of visibility between the two areas. The spatial relationship is linear, with the green pentagons being visible and the red hexagon being invisible due to the obstruction indicated by the arrow.
