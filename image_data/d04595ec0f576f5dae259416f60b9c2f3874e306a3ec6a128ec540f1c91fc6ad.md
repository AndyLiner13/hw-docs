## Content

### Overview
This image depicts a 3D modeling interface within a game development environment. The central area shows a 3D scene with a cube highlighted, surrounded by a bounding box and axis indicators. The left panel displays a hierarchical list of objects, while the right panel contains properties and settings for the selected object.

### Key Elements
- **Left Panel (Hierarchy)**: Located on the left side, it shows a tree-like structure of objects named "RoomB_CylinderClue3," "RoomB_SphereClue4," among others. Each node has a small icon next to it, indicating different types of objects.
- **Central Scene**: The main area of the interface displays a 3D view of a scene with a cube highlighted. The cube is outlined with a white bounding box and has red, green, and blue axis indicators pointing outwards.
- **Right Panel (Properties)**: Positioned on the right, it contains various properties for the selected object "RoomB_CylinderClue3." These include toggles for visibility, collision, and interaction, as well as attributes such as position, rotation, scale, tint color, brightness, and texture asset selection.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual element is the highlighted cube in the central scene. The hierarchy on the left provides context for the objects in the scene, while the properties on the right offer detailed settings for the selected object. There are no arrows or lines connecting elements, but the layout suggests a logical flow from object selection to property adjustment.
