## Content

### Overview
This image depicts a user interface element within a software application, specifically a modal window titled "New asset." The modal is centered over a darker background that appears to be part of a larger application interface, which includes panels on the left side labeled "Build," "Animals," and others. The modal contains fields for entering a name, description, selecting a folder, choosing a thumbnail, and object selection options.

### Key Elements
- **Modal Window**: A dark rectangular box with rounded corners, positioned centrally over the background panels.
  - **Title**: "New asset"
  - **Name Field**: Contains the text "Bouncy Boxes" with a character limit indicator "0/40" next to it.
  - **Description Field**: Displays a partial description starting with "The boxes bounce when you drop them on the floor. The animation curves..."
  - **Folder Selection**: A dropdown menu set to "My Assets."
  - **Thumbnail Section**: Includes a "Choose" button.
  - **Object Selection**: A section with a "Change" button and a note explaining the functionality of changing object selection.
  - **Buttons**: Two buttons at the bottom, "Cancel" and "Create," with the "Create" button highlighted in purple.

- **Back Button**: A circular button with a left-pointing arrow located at the top-left corner of the modal window.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual element is the modal window itself, which is the focal point of the image. The back button is secondary but still noticeable due to its distinct shape and color. The background panels provide context and are slightly blurred compared to the modal window, indicating they are secondary elements. The layout suggests a hierarchical structure where the modal window is the primary action area, followed by the background panels offering additional navigation options.
