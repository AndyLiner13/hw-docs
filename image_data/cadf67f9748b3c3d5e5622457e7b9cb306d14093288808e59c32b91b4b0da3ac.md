## Content

### Overview
This image depicts a 3D modeling software interface, specifically showing a 3D model of a humanoid figure within a grid environment. The right side of the interface displays various properties and settings related to the model, while the left side shows the 3D view of the model and its surrounding environment.

### Key Elements
- **Left Panel (3D View)**:
  - **Visual Description**: A 3D model of a humanoid figure with a blue outline.
  - **Location**: Left side of the image.
  - **Contents**: The humanoid figure is positioned within a grid environment, suggesting a coordinate system for placement and orientation.
  - **Visual Styling**: The figure is rendered in a simple, wireframe-like style with blue edges, and the background is a yellow grid with a darker gray floor.

- **Right Panel (Properties)**:
  - **Visual Description**: A vertical panel displaying various properties and settings.
  - **Location**: Right side of the image.
  - **Contents**:
    - **Match Spawn Point**: A button or label indicating a feature to match spawn points.
    - **Debug Data**: Includes "Generic Entity Data" and "Script Instance Data," with specific IDs provided.
    - **Behavior**: Settings such as "Spawn on start," "Set Position Only," "Player Gravity," "Player Speed," "Force HWXS Camera," and "Enable client smoothing."
    - **Attributes**: Displays position, rotation, and scale values for the model.
    - **GameplayTags**: Partially visible at the bottom.
  - **Visual Styling**: The panel has a dark background with white and light gray text, and some elements have a subtle glow effect.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
- **Most Prominent Visually**: The 3D model in the left panel is the most prominent due to its central placement and larger size.
- **Arrows/Connections**: There are no explicit arrows or connections between elements.
- **Spatial Relationships**: The left panel is adjacent to the right panel, with the 3D model in the left panel being the focal point of the interaction.
