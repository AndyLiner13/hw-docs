## Content

### Overview
This image depicts a hierarchical tree view interface, likely from a software application. It shows a nested structure with expandable nodes, indicated by triangle icons. The nodes contain text labels and small circular icons next to them.

### Key Elements
- **Tree Structure**: A vertical list of nodes, each representing a category or item within a larger structure.
  - **Nodes**: Each node has a triangle icon indicating whether it can be expanded or collapsed.
  - **Text Labels**: Inside each node, there is a label such as "RingTarget," "UBX_RingTarget_6," etc.
  - **Circular Icons**: Small icons next to the text labels, possibly indicating status or action options.
- **Background**: Dark gray background with lighter gray vertical lines separating the nodes.
- **Expand/Collapse Triangles**: Located at the beginning of each node, pointing right when closed and down when expanded.
- **Node Labels**: Text labels are in white, with some in green and others in orange, suggesting different categories or statuses.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
- **Most Prominent Element**: The expandable nodes are the most prominent due to their hierarchical nature.
- **Arrows/Connectors**: There are no explicit arrows or connectors between nodes, but the indentation suggests a parent-child relationship.
- **Spatial Relationships**: Nodes are arranged vertically, with each level indented further than the previous one. The expandable triangles indicate the direction of expansion/collapse.
