## Content

### Overview
This image depicts a user interface from a software application, specifically a modal dialog box that appears over a larger interface. The dialog box is centered and prompts the user to confirm the deletion of a Variable Group. The background interface shows a sidebar menu on the left and a main content area displaying variable groups on the right.

### Key Elements
- **Dialog Box**: A central, semi-transparent overlay with rounded corners. It contains a warning message and two buttons.
  - **Title**: "Delete Variable Group?"
  - **Message**: "If you permanently delete this Variable Group, the scripts that reference the persistent variables inside may no longer work properly."
  - **Warning Icon**: A red triangle with an exclamation mark inside.
  - **Alert Message**: "Variable Group connected to 1 World"
  - **Buttons**: Two buttons labeled "Cancel" and "Delete," both with a pink background and white text.
- **Background Interface**:
  - **Sidebar Menu**: On the left, a vertical menu with options such as "Systems," "Quests," "Leaderboards," "Commerce," and "Variable Groups." The "Variable Groups" option is highlighted.
  - **Main Content Area**: On the right, a list of variable groups with icons and names. One group named "hh1" is highlighted, indicating its connection to a world.
  - **Top Bar**: At the top of the main content area, the title "Variable Groups" is displayed. To the right, there is a "Create Variable Group" button and a dropdown menu labeled "A-Z."

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual element is the dialog box, which is centrally located and draws immediate attention due to its semi-transparent overlay and contrasting colors. The buttons within the dialog box are clearly defined and easily distinguishable. The background interface provides context but does not distract from the dialog box. The spatial relationship is hierarchical, with the dialog box taking precedence over the rest of the interface.
