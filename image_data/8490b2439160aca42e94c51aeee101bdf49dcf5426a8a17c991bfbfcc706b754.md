## Content

### Overview
This image depicts a flowchart with decision points and actions. It starts with a step labeled "start with an entity," followed by a series of yes/no questions and corresponding actions.

### Key Elements
- **Start Box**: Located at the top, it contains the text "> start with an entity". This box is light orange with rounded corners.
- **Decision Box**: Positioned centrally, it asks "Does it have the right tag?" and is highlighted in purple with a hexagonal shape.
- **Yes Path**: Arrows point from the decision box to a green circle containing "> use the entity". The arrow is black with a white outline.
- **No Path - Tag**: Arrows point downward from the decision box to another decision box asking "Does it have a parent?" This box is also purple and hexagonal.
- **No Path - No Parent**: Arrows point to a red circle containing "> stop". This circle has a solid red background with a white outline.
- **No Path - Has Parent**: Arrows point to a light orange rectangle containing "> Shift focus to the parent". This rectangle has a light orange background with a white outline.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The flowchart begins with the start box, then branches into two paths based on the answers to the questions. The yes path leads to the "use the entity" action, while the no path continues to ask if the entity has a parent. If it does not, the process stops. If it does have a parent, the focus shifts to that parent.
