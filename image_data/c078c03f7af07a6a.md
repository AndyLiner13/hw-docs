### Key Elements

- **Message**: "You are reporting the Wood Ball asset. Let us know what's wrong with it so that we can review it." Positioned centrally above the form fields.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual element is the title at the top. The form fields follow logically below the title, with the dropdown menu being the first interactive element. The text area is below the dropdown, and the buttons are at the bottom. There are no arrows or lines connecting elements, but the layout suggests a sequential reading order from top to bottom.
