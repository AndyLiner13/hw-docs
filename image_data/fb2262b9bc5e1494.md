## Content

### Overview
This image depicts a user interface showing a list of unpublished changes within an asset management system. The interface includes a header indicating the number of updates and a tabbed view displaying "Unpublished changes." Below this, there are entries listing assets that have been changed, along with the user who made the change, the date and time of the change, and options to discard or publish the changes.

### Key Elements
- **Header**: "Asset Updates" at the top left, "Updates (0)" next to it, and "Unpublished changes (17)" in the center. A "Publish all" button is located on the far right.
- **Tabbed View**: "Unpublished changes" is highlighted with a blue underline, indicating the active tab.
- **List Entries**: Each entry contains:
  - **Asset Icon**: A small icon representing the asset.
  - **Asset Name**: "a" next to the icon.
  - **Changed By**: "jmavra" with a profile picture icon.
  - **Date**: The timestamp of the change.
  - **Action Buttons**: To the right of each entry, there are "Discard" and "Publish" buttons.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual elements are the list entries, which are arranged vertically. There are no arrows or lines connecting elements, but the layout suggests a linear reading order from top to bottom. The "Publish all" button is the most prominent interactive element due to its placement and contrasting color.
