## Content

### Overview
The image depicts a user interface of a desktop application named "Worlds Desktop Editor." It appears to be a creation tool for building worlds within Meta Horizon Worlds. The layout includes a sidebar menu, a main content area with sections for tutorials, templates, and world creations, and a promotional banner at the top.

### Key Elements
- **Sidebar Menu**: Located on the left side, with options such as "Home," "My worlds," "Tutorials," "Templates," and "Documentation." The "Home" option is highlighted in blue, indicating the current selection.
- **Main Content Area**: Occupies the right side of the screen, divided into sections.
  - **Promotional Banner**: At the top, a banner promotes the Meta Horizon Creator Program with a call-to-action button labeled "Join now."
  - **Getting Started Section**: Contains four tiles, each representing a different starting point for creators. The tiles include:
    - "Start Here" with an image of a character and the text "How to create your first world."
    - "Explore resources and forums" with an image of characters and the text "Unleash your imagination, build your business, and watch your creations grow."
    - "Apply to MHCP" with an image of characters and the text "Gain access to earning opportunities for your creations, helpful resources, a vibrant community, dedicated support, and more."
    - "Get started with documentation" with an image of a cityscape and the text "Learn what it means to be a creator and why you should create for Meta Horizon Worlds."
  - **My Worlds Section**: Displays a grid of world thumbnails with titles and edit timestamps. Examples include "Escape Room Vertical Slice," "Rooftop Racers," "WeaponsTutorial," and "Custom UI Examples."
  - **Tutorials Section**: Below the "My Worlds" section, there are tiles for various tutorials such as "Build Your First Game," "Custom UI Examples," "Simple Shooting Mechanics," and "Spawning and Pooling in TypeScript."

### Visual Flow / Relationships
- **Most Prominent Element**: The "Start Here" tile in the "Getting started" section is the most prominent due to its placement and the "Start Here" button overlay.
- **Arrows/Connectors**: There are no explicit arrows or connectors in the layout.
- **Spatial Relationships**: Elements are arranged in a grid-like structure, with the sidebar menu on the left and the main content area on the right. The promotional banner spans the width of the main content area above the "Getting started" section.
