## Content

### Overview
This image depicts a user interface from a game development or asset management tool. The interface includes a sidebar with a hierarchy view, a central workspace displaying a 3D environment, and a properties panel on the right side. A floating window labeled "Variable Groups" is open, showing a list of player variables.

### Key Elements
- **Sidebar (Left Panel)**: Contains a hierarchical structure with expandable folders labeled "LOBBY," "[ARENA-CORE]," "BROADSIDE," and others. Each folder has a small icon next to it.
- **Central Workspace**: Displays a 3D environment with a room interior, featuring walls, a ceiling, and a door. The environment appears to be part of a game level design.
- **Properties Panel (Right Panel)**: Located on the far right, it currently displays a message stating "Select an object to view its properties."
- **Variable Groups Window**: A floating window titled "Variable Groups" is open. It contains a search bar at the top, followed by a list of player variables such as "DailyEliminationsELIMINATION," "DailyEliminationsPOINTS," "MatchmakingHeuristic," "PlayerCurrencies," "PlayerData," and "PlayerEntitlements." Each variable entry has a small icon next to it, indicating the type of variable (e.g., Player Variable · Number, Player Variable · Object).

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual element is the Variable Groups window, which is open and takes up a significant portion of the screen. The hierarchy view in the sidebar is collapsed, suggesting that the user is focused on the Variable Groups window. The central workspace is blurred, indicating that the focus is on the Variable Groups window and the properties panel. The properties panel is empty, suggesting that no object is currently selected for property viewing.
