## Content

### Overview
This image depicts a user interface element showing version history information. It includes a header, a section for adding contributors, and a timestamp indicating when the version was added.

### Key Elements
- **Header**: Located at the top, labeled "Versions". It has a dark gray background with white text.
- **Added By**: A label in light gray text on the left side.
- **Contributor**: To the right of "Added By," there is a circular profile picture placeholder next to the username "metaeditorcreator," which is written in white text.
- **Date**: Below "Added By," the date "May 2, 2025 at 7:23 PM" is displayed in light gray text.
- **Version History Button**: A rectangular button below the date section, with a dark gray background and white text that reads "Version History."

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual element is the "Version History" button, as it is centrally located and larger than the surrounding elements. The contributor information is secondary but still noticeable due to its placement next to the username. The header acts as a title for the entire section.
