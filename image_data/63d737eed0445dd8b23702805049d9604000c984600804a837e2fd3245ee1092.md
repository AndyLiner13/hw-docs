### Overview
This image depicts a screenshot from a mobile game interface. The central focus is a grid-based puzzle game board filled with various colored gemstones arranged in a pattern. Below the board, there are booster options labeled "Boosters," and at the bottom, there's a home button icon. The top of the screen displays the stage information ("Stage: Abilities"), goal ("Goal: 5"), score ("Score: 2200"), moves remaining ("Moves: 21"), and a settings gear icon.

### Key Elements
- **Game Board**: A grid filled with colorful gemstones (purple, orange, blue, green, red, pink, and brown). The gems are arranged in a specific pattern.
- **Booster Options**: Located below the game board, showing three boosters with corresponding icons and numbers (0, 3, 3).
- **Home Button**: At the bottom center, a circular icon with a house symbol.
- **Stage Information**: At the top left, "Stage: Abilities," "Goal: 5," and "Score: 2200." At the top right, "Moves: 21" and a settings gear icon.
- **Character**: A male character wearing a suit is partially visible on the left side of the screen.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual is the game board, which takes up the majority of the screen space. The booster options are secondary but important for gameplay. The home button is a navigational element, placed at the bottom for easy access. The character is a decorative element, likely representing the player's avatar. The stage information is crucial for understanding the current level status.
