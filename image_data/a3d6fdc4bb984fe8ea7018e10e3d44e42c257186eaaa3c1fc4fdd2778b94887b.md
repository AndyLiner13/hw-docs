## Content

### Overview
This image depicts a user interface from a 3D modeling or animation software application. The central area shows a 3D workspace with a grid layout, featuring a pixelated character model and a plane object. The left side displays a hierarchical structure of objects, while the right side contains various properties and settings related to the selected object. The bottom section shows asset management with folders and frames.

### Key Elements
- **Left Panel (Hierarchy)**: Displays a tree-like structure with nodes labeled "SpawnPoint," "Plane," and "AnimatedGIF." The "Plane" node is highlighted in blue.
- **Central Workspace**: Shows a 3D view with a grid background. A pixelated character model is centered, surrounded by a bounding box. Above the character, there is a purple cube labeled "AnimatedGIF."
- **Right Panel (Properties)**: Contains attributes such as Position, Rotation, Scale, and Gameplay Tags. There are also sections for Physics and More settings.
- **Bottom Section (Assets)**: Lists assets under "My Folders" and "My Assets," with a specific folder named "Nyan Frames" expanded. Below this, there are thumbnail previews of frames labeled "08," "10," "11," and "09."

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual elements are the 3D workspace and the hierarchical structure on the left. The workspace is the central focus, with the character model and plane being the primary objects of interest. The properties panel on the right provides detailed information about the selected object, while the bottom section manages assets. The layout follows a typical workflow where users interact with objects in the workspace, view their properties, and manage assets.
