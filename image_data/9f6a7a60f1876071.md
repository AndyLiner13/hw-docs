This image depicts a user interface of an asset management tool within a software application. The interface includes a sidebar with folders and a main content area displaying asset thumbnails and metadata.

### Key Elements

- **Main Content Area (Right Panel)**:
  - **Asset Thumbnails**: A grid of icons representing different assets.
    - Each thumbnail has a white icon on a gray background.
    - Some thumbnails have additional icons or indicators:
      - A blue circle with a plus sign on one thumbnail.
      - A yellow triangle warning icon on another.
      - A clock icon on yet another.
      - Two blue circular arrows on adjacent thumbnails.
  - **Metadata**: Below the thumbnails, text indicating "Half-Tube Tem..." and "legacy asset," among others.
  - **Status Bar**: At the bottom, a message states "6 assets in My Assets can be updated to a new format" with a "Review" link highlighted in blue.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
- **Most Prominent Element**: The central grid of asset thumbnails.
