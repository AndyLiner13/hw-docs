## Content

### Overview
This image depicts a 3D modeling environment interface, likely from a game development tool such as Unity. The central area shows a 3D scene with a skybox background, a floating sphere, and some objects on a flat surface. The left side displays a hierarchy of objects, while the right side shows properties related to selected objects.

### Key Elements
- **Central Scene**: A large blue skybox with a gradient effect, a white sphere floating near the horizon, and a flat surface with some objects placed on it.
- **Left Panel (Hierarchy)**: Contains a list of objects with icons next to them. Examples include "Sphere," "[SubLevel]," and "[EntityGroup]."
- **Right Panel (Properties)**: Displays a placeholder message "Select an object to view its properties" with a small icon resembling a cube.
- **Bottom Navigation Bar**: Contains tabs labeled "Assets," "Console," "Tests," and "World Health."

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual is the central scene. The hierarchy panel on the left and the properties panel on the right are secondary elements that provide context and interaction points within the interface. There are no arrows or lines connecting elements, but the layout suggests a typical workflow where users interact with objects in the scene and view their properties.
