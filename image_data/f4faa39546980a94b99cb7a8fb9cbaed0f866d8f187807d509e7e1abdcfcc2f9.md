## Content

### Overview
This image depicts a user interface from a game development tool, specifically a quest creation window within a scene editor. The interface includes a sidebar with a hierarchy of objects, a quests panel, and a central area displaying a 3D scene with a cube and a sphere. A modal dialog titled "Create Quest" is open in the center, allowing users to input details for creating a new quest.

### Key Elements
- **Sidebar (Left Panel)**: Contains a hierarchical list of game objects and entities, with expandable groups labeled as "Group," "EntityGroup," "Sphere," etc.
- **Quests Panel**: Located above the sidebar, showing a list of quests under "World Quests." One quest named "saddas" is highlighted, with a script ID displayed.
- **Scene Area**: A 3D view of a simple scene with a white sphere and a gray cube on a green plane, viewed from a top-down perspective.
- **Create Quest Modal Dialog**: Positioned centrally over the scene. It has a dark background with light text and a blue "Create" button at the bottom right. The dialog contains fields for "Script ID," "Name," "Description," "Quest Type," "Who can see this quest?" and "Persistent Variable."

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual element is the "Create Quest" modal dialog, which is the focal point of the interface. The scene area is secondary, providing context for the quest being created. The sidebar serves as a navigation tool, while the quests panel offers a list of existing quests. The layout follows a standard UI design with clear sections and a logical flow from left to right and top to bottom.
