### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual element is the pop-up itself, which is centered and draws attention due to its bright colors and central placement.

The "+" icons and the "Play On" button are arranged symmetrically around the character, guiding the viewer's eye towards the action required to resolve the situation.
