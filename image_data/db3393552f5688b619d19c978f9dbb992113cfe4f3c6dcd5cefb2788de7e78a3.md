## Content

### Overview
This image depicts a user interface of a programming environment, specifically a block-based scripting interface. The interface is titled "Runtime Manager" and contains a series of interconnected blocks representing code snippets. The blocks are arranged in a vertical sequence, indicating a step-by-step process or script flow. The background is a gradient blue, and the interface has a dark theme with light-colored text and highlights.

### Key Elements
- **Title Bar**: Located at the top, labeled "Runtime Manager." It includes a settings gear icon, a copy icon, and a close (X) icon.
- **Code Blocks**: These are the primary elements, arranged vertically. Each block contains text and icons, forming part of a larger script.
  - **Block 1**: "when objSpawned is received with obj + New Param"
  - **Block 2**: "add obj to [ ] objList"
  - **Block 3**: "when spawnEvent is received with + New Param"
  - **Block 4**: "if length of [ ] objList == #0"
  - **Block 5**: "set #objIdx to #0"
  - **Block 6**: "while #objIdx < #numObj"
  - **Block 7**: "Spawn asset asset at position of self + [0 0 1] * #objIdx using 0"
  - **Block 8**: "set #objIdx to #objIdx + #1"
  - **Block 9**: "when despawnEvent is received with + New Param"

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The blocks are arranged in a linear fashion, suggesting a sequential execution of commands. There are no arrows or lines connecting the blocks, but the vertical arrangement implies a step-by-step process. The blocks are closely packed together, with some blocks having nested elements, indicated by the indentation.
