### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual elements are the upload fields, as they are the primary interactive components. The layout follows a grid-like structure with two rows and two columns, each containing a map type and its corresponding upload field. There are no arrows or lines connecting elements, but the placement suggests a sequential process where users must upload files in the correct order before proceeding to the next step.
