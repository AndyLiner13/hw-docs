## Content

### Overview
The image depicts a 3D modeling environment interface showing a cube object in a 3D space. The cube is highlighted with a blue outline, indicating selection or active editing mode. The interface includes a grid background and various toolbars and panels for manipulating the cube.

### Key Elements
- **Cube**: A white cube with a blue outline, located centrally in the image. It has a small gray cube at its center, likely representing the pivot point, with red, green, and blue axes extending from it.
- **Grid Background**: An orange grid pattern covering the entire background, providing a reference for spatial orientation.
- **Toolbars**: Located at the top left, with options such as "Relative," "100%," and a magnifying glass icon.
- **Properties Panel**: On the right side, displaying properties related to the cube. Sections include "Behavior," "Attributes," "Physics," "More," "Navigation," and "Script." The "Navigation" section has a toggle switch labeled "Navigable Surface."

### Visual Flow / Relationships
- **Most Prominent Element**: The selected cube.
- **Spatial Relationships**: The cube is centered, with the grid providing a backdrop. Toolbars are at the top left, and the properties panel is on the right side. There are no arrows or lines connecting elements, but the layout suggests a typical user interface flow where tools are accessed via panels and the workspace is the central area.
