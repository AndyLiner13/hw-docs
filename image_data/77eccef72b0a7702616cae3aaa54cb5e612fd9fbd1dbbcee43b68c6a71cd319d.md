### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual element is the modal window itself, which is centrally located and draws attention due to its darker background compared to the surrounding panels. The modal window is the focal point, with the "Edit Variable Group" title at the top, followed by the description text, name field, description field, toggle switch, and buttons. The left panel and right panel provide contextual information but are secondary to the modal window.
