## Content

### Overview
This image presents four different views of a stone-paved surface at various stages of modeling and texturing. Each view is labeled with a description indicating the process or result being shown.

### Key Elements
1. **Hi-Res Model / Sculpt**
   - **Visual description**: A high-resolution model of a stone-paved surface.
   - **Location**: Leftmost panel.
   - **Contents**: The surface is highly detailed, showing individual stones and cracks.
   - **Visual styling**: Grayish tones, smooth texture, and intricate details.

2. **Low-Res Model**
   - **Visual description**: A low-resolution model of the same surface.
   - **Location**: Second panel from the left.
   - **Contents**: The surface is simplified into a triangular mesh with fewer polygons.
   - **Visual styling**: Light gray triangles forming the low-poly representation.

3. **Texture Baking**
   - **Visual description**: A close-up of the stone-paved surface after applying texture baking.
   - **Location**: Third panel from the left.
   - **Contents**: The surface now has more detail due to the baked textures, though less than the Hi-Res model.
   - **Visual styling**: Gray stones with some white highlights, showing improved detail over the low-res model.

4. **Silhouette + Texture**
   - **Visual description**: A final view combining the silhouette and textured details.
   - **Location**: Rightmost panel.
   - **Contents**: The surface is rendered with both the silhouette and detailed textures, showing a good alignment between the two.
   - **Visual styling**: Gray stones with white and light gray highlights, closely matching the Hi-Res model but with a simpler, more stylized look.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
- **Most prominent visually**: The Hi-Res Model / Sculpt is the most detailed and visually complex.
- **Arrows, lines, connectors**: None present.
- **Spatial relationships**: Panels are arranged horizontally, with each representing a different stage of the modeling process.
