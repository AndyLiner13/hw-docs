## Content

### Overview
This image depicts a user interface from a game development environment, specifically showing a Hierarchy panel, a Properties panel, and a central workspace area. The layout suggests a scene editor or asset management tool within a game engine.

### Key Elements
- **Hierarchy Panel**: Located on the left side, it displays a tree-like structure of assets and objects. The currently selected node is `[AssetPool]`, highlighted in blue. Below it, there are two child nodes labeled `Local Player` and `Local Player (1)`.
- **Properties Panel**: Positioned on the right side, it contains various attributes and settings related to the selected `[AssetPool]`. It includes sections for `Debug Data`, `Attributes`, `Behavior`, and `Gameplay Tags`.
- **Workspace Area**: The central area of the interface is a light blue gradient, likely representing the game world or a viewport where assets can be placed or interacted with.
- **Search Bar**: At the top of the Hierarchy panel, there is a search bar labeled "Search hierarchy" with a magnifying glass icon.
- **Tool Buttons**: Above the search bar, there are several tool buttons, possibly for actions like creating new assets, managing layers, or viewing different views of the hierarchy.
- **Selection Tool**: A hand cursor icon is visible at the top, indicating that the user can select elements within the hierarchy.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual element is the `[AssetPool]` node in the Hierarchy panel, as it is highlighted and expanded. The workspace area serves as the backdrop for the entire interface, providing context for the assets being managed. The Properties panel is closely aligned with the Hierarchy panel, offering real-time information about the selected asset. The search bar and tool buttons are positioned at the top, providing quick access to functionality.
