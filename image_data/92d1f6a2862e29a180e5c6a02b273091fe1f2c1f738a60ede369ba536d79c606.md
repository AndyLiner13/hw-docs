## Content

### Overview
This image depicts a 3D modeling interface with a grid workspace, shape selection panel, and properties panel. The workspace shows a sphere placed at the center. The interface includes various controls for manipulating shapes and objects within the scene.

### Key Elements
- **Shapes Panel**: Located on the left side, it displays a grid of 3D shape options such as cube, sphere, cone, cylinder, ramp, pyramid, tube, half-cylinder, half-tube, faceted-cylinder, capsule, torus, half-sphere, and cube-soft. The sphere option is highlighted with a red bounding box.
- **Workspace**: The central area of the interface is a 3D grid workspace where a white sphere is positioned near the center.
- **Properties Panel**: On the right side, it contains properties related to the selected object (Sphere). It includes toggles for visibility, collision, and attributes like position, rotation, scale, texture, material roughness, color, tag, physics settings, and script attachments.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual element is the sphere in the workspace. The shapes panel is secondary but serves as a reference for selecting new shapes. The properties panel is tertiary, providing detailed information about the currently selected object. There are no arrows or lines connecting elements, indicating a linear reading order from left to right and top to bottom.
