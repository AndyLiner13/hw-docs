## Content

### Overview
This image depicts a user interface element showing properties of a sphere object in a game development or 3D modeling software. The layout is structured into sections for properties, debug data, behavior, attributes, and material settings.

### Key Elements
- **Properties Section**: Located at the top, contains a title "Sphere" with a small icon resembling a cube.
- **Debug Data**: Below the properties, a section labeled "Debug Data" with a right-pointing arrow indicating expandable content.
- **Behavior Section**: Contains toggles and dropdown menus for visibility, light reflection, casting shadows, collision properties, and motion settings.
- **Attributes Section**: Includes fields for position, rotation, scale, texture, material roughness, and color.
- **Position Fields**: Show numerical values for X, Y, Z coordinates.
- **Rotation Fields**: Display numerical values for X, Y, Z angles.
- **Scale Fields**: Similar to position fields but show uniform scaling factors.
- **Texture Dropdown**: A small downward-facing triangle indicating a dropdown menu.
- **Material Roughness Slider**: A slider with a value of 0.5 displayed next to it.
- **Color Field**: Displays a swatch with numerical values for RGB components.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The interface flows vertically, with each section expanding as needed. The toggles and dropdowns are aligned horizontally within their respective sections. The visual hierarchy is clear, with the "Behavior" section being more prominent due to its larger font size compared to the others.
