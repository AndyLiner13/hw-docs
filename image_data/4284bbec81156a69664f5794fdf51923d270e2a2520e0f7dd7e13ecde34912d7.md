### Overview
This image depicts a visual programming interface with a dark theme. It shows a sequence of blocks representing conditional logic and actions within a script editor. The interface includes a control panel at the bottom with a directional pad and a script capacity indicator.

### Key Elements

- **Script Blocks**: Located in the upper left area, these blocks represent conditions and actions. They include:
  - A block labeled "when world is started."
  - Two blocks under "when player purchase succeeds on item" and "when player purchase fails on item," both displaying "display ok" and "display not ok" respectively.
- **Control Panel**: At the bottom, there's a directional pad with a blue lightbulb icon above it, indicating a script action or hint.
- **Bottom Indicator**: Shows "No Errors" and "Script Mode: Default" along with a script capacity of 2%.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The blocks are arranged vertically, with the "when world is started" block at the top, followed by the success and failure conditions. The control panel is positioned at the bottom, and the script capacity indicator is on the far right side.
