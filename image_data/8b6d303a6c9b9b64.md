### Key Elements

  - **Tweaked Properties**: A black box with white text stating "Tweaked some properties."
  - **Buttons**: Two buttons at the bottom, labeled "Cancel" and "Publish." The "Publish" button has a blue background with a loading spinner indicating the action is in progress.

- **Interface Buttons**: Outside the dialog box, there are buttons labeled "Discard" and "Publish" on the right side of the main interface.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual element is the modal dialog box, which is the focal point of the image.
