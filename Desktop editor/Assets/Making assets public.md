# Making assets public

This feature is only available to members of the [Meta Horizon Creator Program](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/programs). Learn more and join today.

## Creating a public asset

You can publish 3D models and asset templates to Public assets. This allows other creators to import and use your assets in their own worlds.
When other creators import and use your assets, they can make changes to the asset locally, but their changes will not affect the published version of the asset.

To make your asset public:

- Select any asset in **My Assets** by clicking on its preview.
