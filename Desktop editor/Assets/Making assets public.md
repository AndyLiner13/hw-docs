# Making assets public

This feature is only available to members of the [Meta Horizon Creator Program](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/programs). Learn more and join today.

## Creating a public asset

You can publish 3D models and asset templates to Public assets. This allows other creators to import and use your assets in their own worlds.
When other creators import and use your assets, they can make changes to the asset locally, but their changes will not affect the published version of the asset.

To make your asset public:

- Select any asset in **My Assets** by clicking on its preview.

- Find your asset in **My Assets**.
- Click on the asset preview to open the **Asset details** panel.
- Modify asset information as needed, including the name, description, category, tags, thumbnail, files and more.

When changes become public, you will see a notification. Following the update, creators will be able to view only the latest version of the asset in **Public assets**. To get a new asset version, creators will need to visit **Public assets** and manually import the latest changes. Previously imported asset versions will not be updated.

## Managing different versions of your public asset

When you update your public asset files, a new version of the asset is created. To manage different versions of your asset open **Version history**. You can do it by clicking on **Version history** in the **Asset details** panel.

  - **v3 is available to users**: A green rounded rectangle.
  - **Asset is not visible to users**: A red rounded rectangle.

- **Public Asset User Section**:
  - **Import Public Asset to a world**: A light blue rounded rectangle labeled "v1".
  - **Import Public Asset to the world**: A light blue rounded rectangle labeled "v3".

### Visual Flow / Relationships
- The flowchart uses arrows to show the progression of actions.
- The most prominent visual elements are the rounded rectangles representing different states or actions.
- Arrows connect the "Create Private Asset" step to "Make Asset Public," then to "v1 is available to users." From here, there are branches to "Import Public Asset to a world" and "Import Public Asset to the world." These steps lead to the "Remix / Clone / Update scripts" action, which has a note indicating it does not impact the original asset.
