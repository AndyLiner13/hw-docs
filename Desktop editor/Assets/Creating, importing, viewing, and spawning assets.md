To import an asset:

- Click the **Add New** button and select the desired asset type.
- When the modal dialog appears, select the desired file(s), resolve any errors, and click **Import**.

Note

 When uploading multiple 3D models, ensure that every texture can be used by all the FBX files.

As your imports are being processed, asset cards with a clock icon will appear for each new item.

### Overview
This image depicts a small interface element, likely part of a larger application or website. It features a geometric shape and some text, suggesting it might be a notification or a badge.

### Key Elements
- **Geometric Shape**: A white, hexagonal shape with a grid pattern inside, located centrally within a rounded rectangular container.
- **Text**: Below the geometric shape, the text reads "coffeemaker-m..." which seems truncated.
- **Background**: The rounded rectangle has a gradient background transitioning from light purple to dark blue.
- **Clock Icon**: In the top right corner, there is a small clock icon, indicating time-related functionality.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual is the geometric shape, as it is the largest element. The text is secondary but still noticeable due to its placement directly beneath the shape. The clock icon is the smallest element, placed in the top right corner, serving as a subtle indicator of time.

### Overview
This image displays two interface elements side by side, likely part of a user interface for managing applications or services. The elements appear to be icons with labels underneath them, suggesting they represent different functionalities or applications.

### Key Elements
- **Left Icon**: A hexagonal shape with a white outline, placed within a blue gradient background. The icon is labeled "Lobby" beneath it.
- **Right Icon**: Similar to the left icon but with a warning triangle icon above it, indicating some form of alert or issue. This icon is labeled "coffeemaker..." beneath it, suggesting it might be related to a coffee machine application or service.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The two icons are arranged horizontally, with no connecting lines or arrows. The left icon is labeled "Lobby," while the right one has a warning symbol, implying a difference in status or functionality between the two.
