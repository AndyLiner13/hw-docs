# Public Assets

## Overview

Public assets is a library of free, publicly available assets that you can import and try out in your own worlds.

**Note:** Public assets compliment your personal and shared assets in My assets, enabling you to store all your assets in one place.

To import assets from public assets:

- Select the **Asset Library** tab below the scene panel, and then click **Public Assets**.

- Use the category and creator filters to find assets that you might be interested in, or use search to find a specific asset.

- You can sort assets by name and date to narrow down your search.

- Select the asset that you want to import and drag it to your scene. This will cause an object to spawn from the asset into your scene and appear in the Hierarchy panel.
- In the Hierarchy panel, modify the new object to suit your needs.
