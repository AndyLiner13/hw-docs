A NPC or Non-Player Character serves as a computer controlled entity designed to enrich a player’s time in your world by offering dynamic and interactive experiences. NPCs added to your world can either be scripted entities set to follow predefined behaviors and animations, complex AI-driven characters capable of dynamically interacting with users in your world, or pre-built NPCs with defined behaviors and actions that can be augmented using the NPC Gizmo.

## Value of Adding NPCs to Your World

Creators can integrate NPCs into their world for a variety of purposes. An NPC can:

* **Provide information or quests** to guide players through storylines.
* **Serve as enemies or obstacles** that players must overcome.
* **Engage players in conversation**, offering dynamic and responsive interactions.
* **Add to the game’s atmosphere and immersion**, making worlds feel more alive.
* **Perform actions** such as navigating the world, grabbing and using objects, and spawning or despawning as needed.

## What’s next?

### NPC Gizmos

The NPC Gizmo is the core entity used to create both scripted and AI-powered Non-Player Characters (NPCs) in Horizon Worlds. Adding the NPC Gizmo to your world and configuring it is the first step to fleshing out your world with a variety of NPCs.

### NPC Animation

NPC animations allow your NPCs to express various actions and states, making them increasingly more dynamic and immersive in your world. These can range from basic, fundamental movements like **idle**, **walk**, and **run**, to specific interactions like attacking, receiving damage, emotes like waving or celebrating. Animations are controlled through scripting for your NPC characters.

### NPC Locomotion

Setting up NPC locomotion enables your created NPCs to move through your world, allowing them to navigate to specific positions, follow waypoints, rotate, stop, or jump. Building navigation for your NPCs is **highly recommended** for mobile NPCs, which involves defining designated walkable areas and characteristics for movement within the environment. This ensures your NPCs can safely and efficiently reach their destinations, avoiding obstacles and correctly traversing terrain features.

### NPC Conversations

Conversations determine how your NPC responds to players in your world. They can be powered by an LLM as an AI NPC, or controlled entirely via scripts. Adding conversation elements to your NPCs in the next step in building an engaging and interactive world.

### NPC Library

The NPC library offers pre-configured NPC characters that can be added to your world. These characters can be found in the **Asset Library** and are ready to be added into your world by dragging them in. These NPCs either come with pre-defined animations, or are examples of features like AI Speech capabilities.

### NPC Tutorial

NPC Tutorials are educational resources and sample worlds designed to help creators configure and add NPCs to their worlds. These tutorials and samples illustrate a range of functionalities available when creating and configuring NPCs. A primary learning tool is the **“NPC Examples world,”** available in the Creation Home’s Tutorials section, which provides practical demonstrations and accompanying scripts.
