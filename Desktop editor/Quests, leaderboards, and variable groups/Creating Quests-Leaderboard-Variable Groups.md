### Overview
This image depicts a user interface from a game development environment, likely a scene editor or level builder. The interface includes a hierarchy view on the left, a preview window in the center, and various toolbars at the top and bottom. The preview window shows a 3D environment with a focus on a corridor and a staircase.

### Key Elements
- **Hierarchy View**: Located on the left side, it displays a tree-like structure of objects and assets within the project. Elements include folders labeled "LOBBY," "[ARENA-CORE]," "BROADSIDE," and others. Some elements have lock icons next to them, indicating locked assets.
- **Search Bar**: Below the hierarchy view, there is a search bar labeled "Search hierarchy."
- **Preview Window**: Occupies the central area of the screen, showing a 3D environment with a corridor and a staircase. The environment has a muted color palette with beige, brown, and gray tones.
- **Toolbars**: At the top, there are several toolbars with icons and dropdown menus. These include navigation options ("Navigation," "Quests," "Variable Groups," "Leaderboards"), system-related options ("Build," "Systems," "Preview," "Scripts"), and a Gen AI button. On the right side, there are additional toolbars with camera controls, zoom settings, and other editing tools.
- **Bottom Toolbars**: At the very bottom, there are tabs labeled "Asset Library," "Console," "Tests," "NPC Debugger," and "Performance." There is also a search bar for the Asset Library and a dropdown menu for sorting assets.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The hierarchy view is the most prominent element on the left, guiding the viewer's attention to the assets and objects within the project. The preview window in the center provides a visual representation of the 3D environment being worked on. The toolbars at the top and bottom offer various functionalities and settings that can be adjusted during the editing process. The layout suggests a workflow where users navigate through the hierarchy, select assets, and then view and edit them in the preview window.
