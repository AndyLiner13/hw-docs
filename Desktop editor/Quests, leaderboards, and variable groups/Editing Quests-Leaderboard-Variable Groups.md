### Visual Flow / Relationships
The hierarchy view is the most prominent element on the left, guiding the viewer's attention to the assets and objects within the project. The preview window in the center provides a visual representation of the 3D environment being worked on. The toolbars at the top and bottom offer various functionalities and settings that can be adjusted during the editing process. The layout suggests a workflow where users navigate through the hierarchy, select assets, and then view and edit them in the preview window.
