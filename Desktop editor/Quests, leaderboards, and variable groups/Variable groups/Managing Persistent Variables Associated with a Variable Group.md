### Overview
This image depicts a user interface from a game development environment, likely a scene editor or level builder. The interface includes a hierarchy view on the left, a preview window in the center, and various toolbars at the top and bottom. The preview window shows a 3D environment with a focus on a corridor and a staircase.

### Key Elements
- **Hierarchy View**: Located on the left side, it displays a tree-like structure of objects and assets within the project. Elements include folders labeled "LOBBY," "[ARENA-CORE]," "BROADSIDE," and others. Some elements have lock icons next to them, indicating locked assets.
- **Search Bar**: Below the hierarchy view, there is a search bar labeled "Search hierarchy."
- **Preview Window**: Occupies the central area of the screen, showing a 3D environment with a corridor and a staircase. The environment has a muted color palette with beige, brown, and gray tones.
- **Toolbars**: At the top, there are several toolbars with icons and dropdown menus. These include navigation options ("Navigation," "Quests," "Variable Groups," "Leaderboards"), system-related options ("Build," "Systems," "Preview," "Scripts"), and a Gen AI button. On the right side, there are additional toolbars with camera controls, zoom settings, and other editing tools.
- **Bottom Toolbars**: At the very bottom, there are tabs labeled "Asset Library," "Console," "Tests," "NPC Debugger," and "Performance." There is also a search bar for the Asset Library and a dropdown menu for sorting assets.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The hierarchy view is the most prominent element on the left, guiding the viewer's attention to the assets and objects within the project. The preview window in the center provides a visual representation of the 3D environment being worked on. The toolbars at the top and bottom offer various functionalities and settings that can be adjusted during the editing process. The layout suggests a workflow where users navigate through the hierarchy, select assets, and then view and edit them in the preview window.

### Overview
The image depicts a user interface from a game development tool, specifically showing a variable management panel within a scene editor. The interface includes a sidebar with a hierarchy of assets, a central panel displaying variable groups, and a preview window showing a part of a game environment.

### Key Elements
- **Sidebar (Left Panel)**: Contains a hierarchical list of assets under categories like "LOBBY," "BROADSIDE," and "SPAWNED." Each asset has a folder icon next to its name.
- **Central Panel (Variable Groups)**: Displays a list of variable groups with icons, names, persistent variables count, collaborators count, and a search bar at the top.
    - **Sample**: 0 Persistent Variables
    - **SuperPlayer**: 57 Persistent Variables, 11 Collaborators
    - **SuperPlayerXFN**: 11 Persistent Variables, 5 Collaborators
- **Preview Window**: Shows a blurred part of a game environment with a "LEADERBOARD" sign visible.
- **Properties Panel (Right Panel)**: Currently empty, with a placeholder message stating "Select an object to view its properties."

### Visual Flow / Relationships
- The most prominent visual element is the central panel displaying variable groups.
- There are no arrows or lines connecting elements, but the layout suggests a logical flow from the sidebar to the central panel and then to the preview window.
- Elements are arranged in a stacked manner, with the sidebar on the left, the central panel in the middle, and the preview window on the right.

### Overview
This image depicts a user interface from a game development or asset management tool. The interface includes a sidebar with a hierarchy view, a central workspace displaying a 3D environment, and a properties panel on the right side. A floating window labeled "Variable Groups" is open, showing a list of player variables.

### Key Elements
- **Sidebar (Left Panel)**: Contains a hierarchical structure with expandable folders labeled "LOBBY," "[ARENA-CORE]," "BROADSIDE," and others. Each folder has a small icon next to it.
- **Central Workspace**: Displays a 3D environment with a room interior, featuring walls, a ceiling, and a door. The environment appears to be part of a game level design.
- **Properties Panel (Right Panel)**: Located on the far right, it currently displays a message stating "Select an object to view its properties."
- **Variable Groups Window**: A floating window titled "Variable Groups" is open. It contains a search bar at the top, followed by a list of player variables such as "DailyEliminationsELIMINATION," "DailyEliminationsPOINTS," "MatchmakingHeuristic," "PlayerCurrencies," "PlayerData," and "PlayerEntitlements." Each variable entry has a small icon next to it, indicating the type of variable (e.g., Player Variable · Number, Player Variable · Object).

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual element is the Variable Groups window, which is open and takes up a significant portion of the screen. The hierarchy view in the sidebar is collapsed, suggesting that the user is focused on the Variable Groups window. The central workspace is blurred, indicating that the focus is on the Variable Groups window and the properties panel. The properties panel is empty, suggesting that no object is currently selected for property viewing.
