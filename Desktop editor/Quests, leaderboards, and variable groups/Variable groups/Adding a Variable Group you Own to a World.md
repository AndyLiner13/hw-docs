### Overview
The image depicts a user interface of a game development environment, specifically showing a scene preview within a 3D editor. The left side displays a hierarchical structure of assets and scenes, while the central area shows a 3D model of a room or corridor. A small dialogue box is visible in the bottom right, indicating some form of interaction or feedback related to the scene.

### Key Elements
- **Left Panel**: Hierarchical structure labeled as "Hierarchy". Contains folders and assets such as "LOBBY", "BROADSIDE", "Strike_Broadside", and others. Each folder has a lock icon next to it, suggesting locked assets.
- **Scene Preview**: Central area showing a 3D model of a corridor or room with a metallic ceiling and walls. The perspective suggests the viewer is looking down a hallway.
- **Dialogue Box**: Located at the bottom right, displaying text that seems to be related to object selection or interaction ("Selection of an object...").
- **Navigation Bar**: At the top, includes options like "Navigation", "Quests", "Variable Groups", and "Leaderboards".
- **Toolbars**: Below the navigation bar, there are toolbars with icons for actions like play, pause, and settings.

  ### Overview
  This image depicts a user interface from a game development tool, specifically showing a variable group management screen within a larger software environment. The interface includes a sidebar with navigation options, a central workspace displaying a 3D scene, and a properties panel on the right side. The focus is on the "Variable Groups" section, which lists persistent variables associated with specific player characters.
  
  ### Key Elements
  - **Sidebar (Left Panel)**: Contains a hierarchical tree view labeled "Hierarchy," with various nodes such as "ConstsWorld," "[ARENA-CORE]," and "Player Assets." The "Player Assets" node is expanded, revealing multiple sub-nodes.

### Overview
This image depicts a user interface from a game development or asset management tool. The interface includes a sidebar with a hierarchy of assets, a central workspace displaying a 3D environment, and a properties panel on the right side. A contextual menu is open over the 3D environment, showing options related to variable groups.

### Key Elements
- **Sidebar (Left Panel)**: Contains a hierarchical list of assets under categories like "ConstsWorld," "[ARENA-CORE]," "[Environment] BeautyCorner_Sky," and others. The list is nested, with some items expanded to show sub-assets.
- **Central Workspace**: Displays a 3D environment with a pinkish hue and geometric shapes. A contextual menu is open over this area, offering actions such as "Add to world," "Sharing permissions," "Edit variable group," "View details," and "Delete."
- **Properties Panel (Right Panel)**: Currently empty, with a placeholder message indicating that no object has been selected to view its properties.
- **Variable Groups Panel**: Located above the central workspace, showing a list of variable groups with one named "Sample." There are options to display variables owned by the user.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual element is the contextual menu over the 3D environment. The menu is aligned with the workspace, suggesting interaction with the 3D model. The hierarchy sidebar is static and serves as a reference for navigating through assets. The properties panel is currently inactive but ready to display information once an object is selected. The bottom section provides a grid of assets available for use.
