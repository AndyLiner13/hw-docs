# Using Variable Groups

Variable groups let you create sets of persistent variables that you can share across your worlds. This approach lets you build cross-world experiences using persisted information from any of your worlds. You can access the variable groups system from the **Systems** tab of creator tools. On this tab, you’ll find three sub-tabs that display the following types of variable groups. Those:

* **Added to the World**
* **Owned by Me**
* **Shared with Me**

With the introduction of variable groups, you are no longer restricted to using just six variable groups per world; you can create as many variable groups as you want.

> **Note:** To use the persistent variables from a variable group in your world, you must add that variable group to your world.

Once you create a variable group, you can then edit it, or delete it. Be careful when you delete a variable group, and when you edit its name. Editing the name requires that you update all of your scripts that use persistent variables from that variable group. Deleting a variable group also deletes all of its persistent variables, which breaks any scripts using them.
