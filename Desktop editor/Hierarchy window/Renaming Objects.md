### Overview
This image depicts a screenshot of a user interface, specifically a hierarchy view within a software application. The interface shows a list of objects or entities, each represented as a node in a tree-like structure. The focus is on the "Cube" node, which is highlighted with a blue border, indicating selection or active focus.

### Key Elements
- **Visual description**: The interface has a dark theme with light text and icons.
- **Location**: The "Cube" node is located in the center of the list, slightly shifted to the right due to the highlighted selection.
- **Contents**: The text "Cube" is displayed next to a small icon resembling a cube.
- **Visual styling**: The text is white, the background is dark gray, and the highlighted selection uses a blue border.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
- **Most prominent visually**: The "Cube" node is the most prominent due to its highlighted selection.
- **Arrows, lines, connectors**: There are no arrows or lines connecting nodes, as this is a flat list rather than a hierarchical tree with connections.
- **Spatial relationships**: Nodes are arranged vertically in a list format, with each node having a small icon and text label. The "Cube" node is the focal point, with the rest of the list items stacked below it.
