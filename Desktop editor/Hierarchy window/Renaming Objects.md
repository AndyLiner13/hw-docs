### Overview
This image depicts a user interface element showing a hierarchical list of objects within a software application. The interface includes a search bar at the top and a list of object names arranged vertically. The highlighted item indicates the current selection.

### Key Elements

    - **Cube**: Highlighted with a blue background and a white border, indicating it is currently selected.
    - **Other Objects**: Names include "SpawnPoint," "Cone," "Cylinder C," etc., each with a corresponding icon next to them.
- **Icons**: Small icons next to each object name represent the shape of the object.
- **Background**: Dark gray with a subtle gradient effect.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The visual hierarchy is clear due to the blue highlight on the "Cube" entry. The list items are aligned vertically, and the search bar is positioned at the top. There are no arrows or lines connecting elements, but the blue highlight guides the viewer's attention to the selected item.
