# Filtering and Searching in the Hierarchy Window

You can filter for:

- Assets and gizmos in your virtual world, including:
  - Properties: Tri-Mesh, SubD (helpful when needing to find and remove SubD assets)
  - Gizmo types
- Objects attached to specific scripts

## Using the filter

The following steps show how to use the filter:

- Click on the filter button next to the Hierarchy Search Bar to open the filter:

### Overview
The image displays a user interface with two main sections: a hierarchical list on the left and a filtering menu on the right. The interface appears to be part of a software tool, possibly related to game development or asset management.

### Key Elements
- **Left Panel (Hierarchy)**:
  - **Visual description**: A vertical list with expandable nodes.
  - **Location**: Left side of the image.
  - **Contents**: Nodes labeled with items like "[Spawn Point]", "[Door]", "[Environment]", etc.
  - **Visual styling**: Dark background with white text and light gray expand/collapse indicators.

- **Right Panel (Filtering Menu)**:
  - **Visual description**: A vertical menu with expandable sections.
  - **Location**: Right side of the image.
  - **Contents**: Sections include "Properties", "Attached scripts", and "Gizmo types". Each section contains expandable items like "Tri-Mesh", "SubD", "Script1", etc.
  - **Visual styling**: Dark background with white text and light gray expand/collapse indicators.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
- **Most prominent visually**: The hierarchical list on the left.
- **Arrows/lines/connectors**: Expand/collapse indicators next to node names.
- **Spatial relationships**: The left panel is wider than the right panel, and both panels are adjacent without overlapping.

</details>

<p></p>



  * **Properties:** The Properties section allows filtering by the properties of assets, and supports filtering to show only “Tri-Mesh” assets and only “SubD” assets. All Tri-Mesh assets are labeled “Tri-Mesh” so you can verify them.
  * **Attached Scripts:** The Attached Scripts section allows filtering to show only the objects that have the specific selected script attached.
  * **Gizmo types:** Similar to above, the Gizmo Types section allows filtering to gizmos that match the gizmo type selected.
  * **NOTE that filtering uses OR Logic** : Filtering uses “OR” logic across all categories. For example, if you filter by “Script 1” and “Tri-Mesh,” it will display all objects that are “Tri-Mesh” OR have “Script 1” attached OR have *both* “Tri-Mesh” and “Script 1” attached.
