### Overview
This image depicts a user interface from a software application, likely a 3D modeling or game development tool. The central focus is a virtual environment rendered within the application, featuring a scoreboard and some interactive elements. On the right side, there is a properties panel displaying various attributes of a selected object named "BroadcastTextLabel."

### Key Elements
- **Central Scene**: A virtual environment with a scoreboard labeled "Scoreboard." The scoreboard has a blue and white design with a circular element behind it. There are also some purple blocks with text and icons near the scoreboard.
- **Foreground Text**: A large, golden-yellow banner with the text "Hello World!" prominently displayed in black font.
- **Properties Panel**: Located on the right side, showing attributes such as "Behavior," "Attributes," and "Physics." The "Behavior" tab is active, displaying options like "Visible," "Light & Shadow," and "Auto Fit." The "Attributes" section includes fields for "Position," "Rotation," "Scale," and "Color."
- **Hierarchy Panel**: On the left side, a tree-like structure labeled "Hierarchy" with nodes like "BroadcastTextLabel," "BroadcastTextBackground," "BroadcastTextLeftCylinder," and "BroadcastTextRightCylinder."
- **Control Bar**: At the top, there are standard control buttons typically found in video editing or game development software, including play, pause, and step forward/reverse buttons.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual element is the "Hello World!" banner, which draws attention due to its size and bright color. The scoreboard and surrounding elements provide context for the virtual environment. The properties panel on the right offers detailed information about the selected object, while the hierarchy panel on the left allows navigation through the project structure. The control bar at the top suggests functionality for playback and navigation within the application.

### Overview
This image depicts a 3D modeling software interface, specifically a scene view within a game development environment. The central area shows a 3D scene with a skybox background, a grid floor, and several 3D models placed within the scene. The left side displays a hierarchical list of objects, while the right side shows properties for selected objects.

### Key Elements
- **Scene View**: Central area showing a 3D scene with a blue sky gradient, a white sphere floating above a platform, and a grid floor. The platform has red cubes arranged on it.

- **Properties Panel**: Right side, currently empty as no object is selected. It prompts users to "Select an object to view its properties."
- **Navigation Controls**: Top bar includes buttons for play, step forward, step backward, and other scene navigation options.
- **View Settings**: Options for local view, centering, and zoom level adjustments are located at the top.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual element is the 3D scene in the center. The hierarchy panel on the left provides context for the objects displayed in the scene. The properties panel on the right is designed to display information about the selected object but is currently inactive. Navigation controls are positioned at the top for easy access during scene manipulation.

</details>

**NOTE:** You can also click individual objects in the scene while holding Shift or Ctrl to add or remove them from the current selection.

## Duplicate selected objects

After selecting an object, or multiple objects, in the hierarchy view you can duplicate it to create multiple instances of the same object. Duplicating your existing objects can help reduce the time needed to create things like multiple instances of an item or texture that needs to be repeated or reused.

To do so use the following process:

- Select an object or objects in the hierarchy view.
- Right click and select **Duplicate selection** from the pop-up menu. You can also use the keyboard shortcut **Ctrl + D**.

</details>

<p></p>


- Your selected objects, including any child objects, will appear in the hierarchy view.

## Sub-Object Selection

In the Desktop Editor, you can’t select a single sub-object of a group simply by clicking on it in the scene.

Sub-object selection is a feature for the Desktop Editor that lets you select sub-objects in the scene using a second click.

* The first click selects the group.
* The second click selects the sub-object that you clicked on.

**NOTE**: Sub-object selection applies only to groups. For sub-objects in regular hierarchies, the first click still selects the sub-object. To select the parent object, you can simply select it directly.

### User flow

Use this procedure to try out sub-object selection.

- In the Desktop Editor, travel to any world in Edit mode.
- In the world, either create a new group of entities, or find an existing group.
- Click on one of the objects in the group. The entire group is selected.
- Click on the same object again. The sub-object is selected.
- You can repeat this procedure again with nested groups.

## Selecting simulated objects and ghost visuals

While running a simulation, animated or physics objects (the objects that move) leave behind a ghost visual at their origin point.

## Marquee selection

Marquee selection makes it easier to select multiple objects. It simplifies the selection process by allowing you to select more than one object by creating a box around the objects you want selected and highlighting them in blue.

#### How to use marquee selection

- In the Desktop Editor, click and drag a selection box over the objects that you want to select.
  - All non-locked and visible objects within the box become outlined in blue.
  - Child objects not within the selection box but with parents that are within the selection box are outlined in white.
  - Any object within the selection box and belonging to either a group or asset template instance will result in the entire group/asset template instance being outlined in blue. <details>
