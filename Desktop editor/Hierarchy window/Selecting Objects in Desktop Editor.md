**Note:** To redirect the view towards a specific object, select an object and press the “F” key.

## Selecting multiple objects

You can select multiple objects in the Hierarchy panel in the following ways:

* Select an object, then hold the Ctrl key and click another object to add it to the selection. You may repeat this until all the desired objects are selected. You can also use this method to deselect individual objects.

### Overview
This image depicts a 3D modeling environment interface, likely from a game development tool such as Unity. The central area shows a 3D scene with a skybox background, a floating sphere, and some objects on a flat surface. The left side displays a hierarchy of objects, while the right side shows properties related to selected objects.

### Key Elements
- **Central Scene**: A large blue skybox with a gradient effect, a white sphere floating near the horizon, and a flat surface with some objects placed on it.
- **Left Panel (Hierarchy)**: Contains a list of objects with icons next to them. Examples include "Sphere," "[SubLevel]," and "[EntityGroup]."
- **Right Panel (Properties)**: Displays a placeholder message "Select an object to view its properties" with a small icon resembling a cube.
- **Bottom Navigation Bar**: Contains tabs labeled "Assets," "Console," "Tests," and "World Health."

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual is the central scene. The hierarchy panel on the left and the properties panel on the right are secondary elements that provide context and interaction points within the interface. There are no arrows or lines connecting elements, but the layout suggests a typical workflow where users interact with objects in the scene and view their properties.

**NOTE:** You can also click individual objects in the scene while holding Shift or Ctrl to add or remove them from the current selection.

## Duplicate selected objects

After selecting an object, or multiple objects, in the hierarchy view you can duplicate it to create multiple instances of the same object. Duplicating your existing objects can help reduce the time needed to create things like multiple instances of an item or texture that needs to be repeated or reused.

To do so use the following process:

- Select an object or objects in the hierarchy view.
- Right click and select **Duplicate selection** from the pop-up menu. You can also use the keyboard shortcut **Ctrl + D**.

    - **Create Asset**: The second option.
    - **Delete selection**: The third option, with a keyboard shortcut "Del" next to it.
    - **Group selection**: The fourth option, with a keyboard shortcut "Ctrl + G" next to it.
    - **Focus on selection**: The fifth option, with a keyboard shortcut "F" next to it.
    - **Create parent object**: The last option in the menu.
  - **Visual styling**: The menu has a dark theme with white text and light gray highlights. The highlighted option "Cube" has a blue background.
  
  ### Visual Flow / Relationships
  - **Most prominent visually**: The dropdown menu is the most prominent feature as it is the focal point of the image.
  - **Arrows, lines, connectors**: There are no arrows, lines, or connectors in the image.
  - **Spatial relationships**: The dropdown menu is adjacent to the "Cube" item, indicating that the menu is triggered by interacting with the "Cube" item.

- Your selected objects, including any child objects, will appear in the hierarchy view.

## Sub-Object Selection

In the Desktop Editor, you can’t select a single sub-object of a group simply by clicking on it in the scene.

Sub-object selection is a feature for the Desktop Editor that lets you select sub-objects in the scene using a second click.

* The first click selects the group.
* The second click selects the sub-object that you clicked on.

**NOTE**: Sub-object selection applies only to groups. For sub-objects in regular hierarchies, the first click still selects the sub-object. To select the parent object, you can simply select it directly.

### User flow

Use this procedure to try out sub-object selection.

- In the Desktop Editor, travel to any world in Edit mode.
- In the world, either create a new group of entities, or find an existing group.
- Click on one of the objects in the group. The entire group is selected.
- Click on the same object again. The sub-object is selected.
- You can repeat this procedure again with nested groups.

## Selecting simulated objects and ghost visuals

While running a simulation, animated or physics objects (the objects that move) leave behind a ghost visual at their origin point.

## Marquee selection

Marquee selection makes it easier to select multiple objects. It simplifies the selection process by allowing you to select more than one object by creating a box around the objects you want selected and highlighting them in blue.

#### How to use marquee selection

- In the Desktop Editor, click and drag a selection box over the objects that you want to select.
  - All non-locked and visible objects within the box become outlined in blue.
  - Child objects not within the selection box but with parents that are within the selection box are outlined in white.
  - Any object within the selection box and belonging to either a group or asset template instance will result in the entire group/asset template instance being outlined in blue. <details>
