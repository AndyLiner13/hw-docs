  **Note**: If you do not provide a name for your new world, it will still exist and be saved as normal. However, the next time you open it, it will be called “New World” with the count of how many worlds you’ve created without names appended to it (for instance, “New World 4.” If you do this several times, you may end up with multiple worlds called by similar names, potentially causing confusion. You can always rename it to something else at a later time.
- Click **Save**.
