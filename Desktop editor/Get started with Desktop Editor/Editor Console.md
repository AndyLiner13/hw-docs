# Editor Console

The Editor Console is a pane that appears at the bottom of the Desktop Editor screen. It displays a running list of status messages generated by the editor, and by the Meta Horizon Worlds runtime. These messages contain information intended to help you find and fix problems with your world.

The console displays the following three kinds of messages:

| **Type of Status Message** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| Compilation Status | Messages generated as your world builds. |
| System Warning | Error messages generated by the Meta Horizon Worlds runtime as it runs your world. |
| Debugging | These messages are the result of calls that you make in your code. They come from CodeBlocks, DebugMessage blocks, and script calls to `console.log()`. |

This article describes the parts of the Console UI, and it explains how to access and use the console.

## How to access the console

By default, the console pane doesn’t appear on the editor screen. Instead, it displays in a tab (collapsed by default) located beneath the **Scene** pane.

### Overview
This image shows a user interface element at the bottom of a software application, likely a game development tool given the grid background resembling a 3D workspace. The interface includes tabs labeled "Assets," "Console," and "Tests."

### Key Elements
- **Tab "Assets"**: Located on the far left, it is a dark gray tab with white text that reads "Assets." There is no icon next to the text.
- **Tab "Console"**: Positioned in the center, this tab has a darker shade than the others and contains the word "Console" in white text. A hand cursor is hovering over this tab, indicating it is the active tab.
- **Tab "Tests"**: Situated on the far right, it is similar in design to the "Assets" tab but with the word "Tests" written in white text.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual element is the "Console" tab due to the hand cursor hovering over it. The tabs are arranged horizontally, and there are no arrows or lines connecting them, suggesting a linear navigation flow where users can switch between these tabs.

### Overview
This image depicts a user interface section of a software application, specifically a console view within a development environment. The interface includes tabs for "Assets," "Console," and "Tests." Below these tabs, there are indicators for "Status View" showing counts of informational messages ("i"), warnings ("W"), and errors ("E").

### Key Elements
- **Tabs**: Located at the top, these include "Assets," "Console," and "Tests." They are dark-colored rectangles with white text.
- **Status View Indicator**: A dropdown menu labeled "Status View" with a downward arrow indicating a dropdown menu.
- **Count Indicators**: Three blue rectangular boxes show counts of informational messages ("i 8"), warnings ("W 1"), and errors ("E 2").
- **Messages Section**: Below the count indicators, there is a list of messages under the "Turtles" category. Each message has a red "X" icon next to it, indicating errors. The messages read:
  - "Cannot find name 'cowabunga'."
  - "Cannot find name 'dude'."
- **Warnings Section**: To the right of the messages, there are columns for "WARNINGS" and "ERRORS." The "ERRORS" column shows "0" for "Turtles" and "2" for "Dogs."
- **Additional Messages**: Below the "Turtles" messages, there are two additional messages:
  - "Not compiled on the local client."
  - "Not compiled on the server."

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual elements are the error messages under the "Turtles" category. The layout follows a grid-like structure with messages aligned vertically under their respective categories. There are no arrows or lines connecting elements, but the visual hierarchy is clear through the use of color coding and indentation.

## Console toolbar

The console toolbar contains the following controls.

| **Control** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
|  | Deletes all of the log messages in the console. Does not depend on world status. You cannot undo this action. |
|  | Display and hide log messages by log level. The log levels are: `Information`, `Warnings`, and `Errors`. Enable a message log level by clicking its icon. |
|  | Search for log messages (or apply a filter). You can input a string (case sensitive) or a regular expression. |

You can combine filters with log levels to increase your search granularity.

## Console message list

Every console message includes the following details.

| **Type of Information** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| Log level | Log messages are ranked by severity. The severity levels are: `Information`, `Warning`, and `Error`. |
| Log message | The text contained in the first line of the log message. |
| Log count | The number of times that a particular log message generated consecutively. |
| Log time | The log message’s timestamp. |
| Object | The object (entity) that spawned the message. |
| Source | The script that spawned the message. |

## Console message inspector

The Message Inspector is a window that displays details for a particular log message when you select a particular log message. The details displayed include:

* The log’s message in its entirety, in a scrollable view.
* The log message’s metadata.

**Tip** : You can dismiss the Message Inspector by selecting the log message again.
