# Editor Console

The Editor Console is a pane that appears at the bottom of the Desktop Editor screen. It displays a running list of status messages generated by the editor, and by the Meta Horizon Worlds runtime. These messages contain information intended to help you find and fix problems with your world.

The console displays the following three kinds of messages:

| **Type of Status Message** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| Compilation Status | Messages generated as your world builds. |
| System Warning | Error messages generated by the Meta Horizon Worlds runtime as it runs your world. |
| Debugging | These messages are the result of calls that you make in your code. They come from CodeBlocks, DebugMessage blocks, and script calls to `console.log()`. |

This article describes the parts of the Console UI, and it explains how to access and use the console.

## How to access the console

By default, the console pane doesn’t appear on the editor screen. Instead, it displays in a tab (collapsed by default) located beneath the **Scene** pane.

### Overview
This image depicts a user interface element showing a navigation bar at the bottom of a screen. The background is a grid pattern, suggesting a workspace or development environment. The navigation bar contains three tabs labeled "Assets," "Console," and "Tests."

### Key Elements
- **Visual description**: The navigation bar has a dark background with white text and a light gray grid overlay.
- **Location**: The navigation bar spans the width of the screen at the bottom.
- **Contents**:
  - **Assets**: Located on the far left, the tab reads "Assets."
  - **Console**: This tab is highlighted, indicating it is currently active. It has a white background with black text and a small downward-pointing arrow icon next to the word "Console."
  - **Tests**: Located on the far right, the tab reads "Tests."
- **Visual styling**: The tabs have a clean, modern look with a subtle shadow effect under them, giving a slight 3D appearance.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual element is the "Console" tab, which is highlighted. There are no arrows or lines connecting the elements, but the layout suggests a linear progression through the tabs. The grid background implies a workspace environment, possibly for game development or similar software.

### Overview
This image depicts a user interface section of a software application, specifically a console or log viewer within a development environment. The interface includes a list of messages categorized under "Turtles" and "Dogs," with indicators for warnings and errors.

### Key Elements
- **Header**: Located at the top, showing tabs labeled "Assets," "Console," and "Tests." Below these tabs, there's a dropdown menu labeled "Status View."
- **Message List**: Underneath the header, there's a list of messages categorized into "Turtles" and "Dogs."
  - **Turtles**: Contains two error messages:
    - "Cannot find name 'cowabunga'."
    - "Cannot find name 'dude'."
    - There's also a note indicating that the code is "Not compiled on the local client."

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The visual hierarchy is established by the placement of the header above the message entries. The messages are arranged in a vertical list, with the most recent messages appearing at the bottom. The blue highlight on Entry 3 draws attention to that specific error message.

</details>

- **Toolbar**: Contains controls that let you clear and filter message logs.
- **Header**: Arranges the message details in a structured format to make the information easy to find, and easy to read. In this format, log messages display along with associated metadata, and the name of the script and or world object that generated the message.

- **Console Message Inspector**: Displays full text and metadata for a selected log message. Clicking on the currently selected log message closes the inspector.

## Status View

The Status View displays compilation information about each one of your scripts for each connected client, and for the server. Details include the current status of each one of your scripts. Script status is either `Not Compiled`, `Compiling`, or `Finished Compiling`. These details are displayed along with timestamps of the latest update for each script. Compilation errors and warnings are also shown.

Build log messages on this tab aren’t displayed in chronological order. Instead they’re organized by script. The list displays details from just the most recent script compilation. Status View also shows the compilation time on each connected client, along with any compilation errors.

## Simulation View

The Simulation View displays `console.log()` messages from your code, as well as system errors and warnings, in chronological order.
