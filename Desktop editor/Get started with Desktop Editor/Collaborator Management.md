# Collaborator Management

These features enable you to manage world collaborators in the Desktop Editor. This includes viewing, inviting, and removing collaborators, as well as editing a collaborator’s role, and accepting or rejecting an invitation to collaborate.

**Note**: When multiple collaborators are present in a world, **Auto-stop simulation on Preview exit** setting is bypassed so a collaborator exiting Preview mode will not disrupt the work-flow of other collaborators.

## Viewing Collaborators

- Open or create a new world.
- Your avatar is located in the upper right of the main toolbar. Any collaborators that are active in your world will appear here.
