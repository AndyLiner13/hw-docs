# Modifying editable entity properties

Many of the properties of objects in your world can be modified after you’ve added them. To edit the property of an object, click the object to select it. This lets you see its available properties using the **Properties** panel.

**To modify the properties of an object**

- Select an object in the **Hierarchy** panel or in the **Scene** panel of the desktop editor.

  ### Overview
  This image depicts a 3D modeling environment interface, likely from a game development tool such as Unity. The screen is divided into two main sections: a hierarchy panel on the left and a 3D view on the right.
  
  ### Key Elements
  - **Hierarchy Panel**: Located on the left side of the screen. Contains a tree-like structure with nodes labeled "Spawn Point," "Correlated Scripts," and "Environment." The "Spawn Point" node is highlighted with a red bounding box.
  - **3D View**: Occupies the right side of the screen. Displays a 3D scene with a grid floor and walls. A green diamond-shaped object is centered in the scene, outlined with a red bounding box.
  - **Scene Text**: In the center of the 3D view, the word "Start" is displayed in white text.
  
  ### Visual Flow / Relationships
  The most prominent visual elements are the highlighted "Spawn Point" node and the green diamond object. The hierarchy panel is vertically aligned on the left, while the 3D view occupies the rest of the screen. There are no arrows or lines connecting elements, but the layout suggests a typical user interface where the left panel provides navigation and the right panel displays the current scene.

- Navigate to the object’s **Properties** panel, search for the **Attributes** category, then change the value of the **Tint Color** to *(1, 0, 0)* and the **Tint Strength** to *1.00*. Your object will change from the color Green to Red.

  ### Overview
  This image depicts a user interface element within a software application, specifically a settings or properties panel. The focus is on a section labeled "Attributes," which includes various parameters such as Position, Rotation, Scale, Tint Color, and Tint Strength. The interface has a dark theme with a mix of text fields, sliders, and color pickers.
  
  ### Key Elements
  - **Tint Color**: Located in the middle of the Attributes section, highlighted with a red rectangle. Contains a color picker with a red square indicating the current tint color.
  - **Tint Strength**: Positioned next to the Tint Color, showing a value of 1.00.
  - **Position, Rotation, Scale**: These parameters are listed above the Tint Color section, each with numerical values displayed in text fields.
  - **Attributes Section Header**: Located at the top of the Attributes area, with a collapsed arrow indicating more options underneath.
  - **Debug Data and Behavior Headers**: Located above the Attributes section, suggesting additional settings or data related to the object being configured.
  
  ### Visual Flow / Relationships
  The most prominent visual element is the Tint Color section, as it is highlighted and positioned centrally within the Attributes area. The Tint Strength is adjacent to it. The Position, Rotation, and Scale parameters are arranged vertically above the Tint Color section. The Debug Data and Behavior headers are positioned above the Attributes section, suggesting they are part of the same overarching settings panel.

  ### Overview
  This image depicts a user interface element within a software application, specifically a settings or configuration panel. The panel includes various properties and toggles related to object behavior.
  
  ### Key Elements
  - **Visible Toggle**: Located in the middle-left area, this toggle is labeled "Visible." It has a white background with a black square indicating the toggle switch.
  - **Reflect Light & Cast Shadow Toggle**: Positioned below the Visible toggle, this toggle is labeled accordingly. It has a white background with a black square indicating the toggle switch.
  - **Collidable Toggle**: Situated further down, this toggle is labeled "Collidable." It has a blue background with a white square indicating the toggle switch.
  - **Collision Layer Dropdown**: Below the Collidable toggle, this element is labeled "Collision Layer" and features a dropdown menu with the option "Everything" selected.
  - **Motion Dropdown**: At the bottom, this element is labeled "Motion" and features a dropdown menu with the option "None" selected.
  
  ### Visual Flow / Relationships
  The most prominent visual element is the "Visible" toggle, as it is highlighted with a red bounding box. The toggles are arranged vertically, with the "Visible" toggle being the first and most noticeable due to its highlighted status. The layout suggests a hierarchical relationship where the "Visible" toggle is likely the primary setting that controls the visibility of the object.
