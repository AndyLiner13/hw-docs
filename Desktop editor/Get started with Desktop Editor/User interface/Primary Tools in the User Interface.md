The Camera speed controls enable you to adjust the camera speed within your world and adjust the location of the camera.

Camera speed is the rate at which the camera moves when you’re navigating through your world. With this, you can customize the navigation experience to suit your needs. For example, you might find a faster camera speed useful for quickly exploring large areas, or a slower camera speed more suitable for precise movements.
