# Build and Preview Modes

**Build** mode and **Preview** mode let you to switch back and forth between building your world in the desktop editor and seeing how it looks to users.

The desktop editor loads in **Build** mode by default when you open it. This enables you to immediately start building a world, creating a scene, or placing objects.

You can then use **Preview** mode to test-run your world, experiencing it fully rendered, with scripts executing in order to ensure it works properly. With this, you can interact with your partially-developed world, test world mechanics, and see player controls and interaction prompts. For more information, see [Preview Mode](/hw-docs/Desktop%20editor/Get%20started%20with%20Desktop%20Editor/Preview%20mode.md).

You can change modes by selecting the appropriate mode button at the top of the editor.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Build** | Build mode button |
| **Preview** | Preview mode button |

**Note**: Your cursor isn’t visible while in **Preview** mode. Instead, the cursor is used to change your avatar’s orientation, as opposed to the arrow keys or WASD keys, which are used to move in different directions based on the orientation of your avatar. Click **ESC** twice to exit **Preview** mode.
