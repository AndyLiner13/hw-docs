[Object tools in the Desktop Editor](../../../../../images/output/img_20251211_044904_20251211_044904.md)

### Overview
This image depicts a toolbar interface with various controls and options. The layout suggests a user interface likely from a software application, possibly related to video editing or similar tasks given the presence of angle measurement and percentage adjustment tools.

### Key Elements
- **Local, Center, Relative**: These are dropdown menus located at the top of the toolbar. They appear to allow users to select different modes for adjusting angles or percentages.
- **Angle Measurement**: A small icon resembling a protractor is positioned next to the dropdown labeled "10°". This likely indicates the current angle setting.
- **Percentage Adjustment**: A slider or input field showing "10%" is situated next to the angle measurement tool. It seems to allow users to adjust a value in increments of 10%.
- **Cursor Icon**: A standard arrow cursor icon is visible at the far left, indicating the mouse pointer's current position within the interface.
- **Additional Icons**: There are several icons at the very left side of the toolbar, which might represent different functions or settings. These include a plus sign, a minus sign, a circular icon, and another icon that resembles a gear or settings symbol.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The elements are arranged horizontally across the top of the toolbar. The angle measurement and percentage adjustment tools are closely grouped together, suggesting they are related functionalities. The Local, Center, and Relative dropdowns are positioned above these tools, implying they control the context in which the angle and percentage adjustments are applied.

Snapping objects to values helps you align them precisely. By default, the Desktop Editor uses Relative snapping, but you can change it to use Absolute snapping.

| Snap Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Relative | Aligns objects based on their current position relative to other objects. This is useful to maintain consistent spacing or alignment between multiple objects in your scene. |
