You can use the **Snapping** tools to precisely translate, rotate, and scale objects in your scene by forcing the object to *snap* to a whole value, into a new position, orientation, or scale.

The following snapping tools are availabe in the Desktop Editor UI:

* [Translation Grid Snap](Object%20tools.md#translation-grid-snap)
* [Rotation Angle Snap](Object%20tools.md#rotation-angle-snap)
* [Scale Snap](Object%20tools.md#scale-snap)
* [Relative or Absolute Snap](Object%20tools.md#relative-or-absolute-snap)
* [Snap to Surfaces](Object%20tools.md#snap-to-surfaces)

### Translation Grid Snap

[The Relative or Absolute Snap tool](../../../image_data/e4457ef09eea6150d6f7eb3becfa59dbbddb639d3df7381996528e03ab7e1094.md)

### Overview
This image depicts a dropdown menu interface element with a toggle button and a list of options underneath. The overall composition includes a button with a downward arrow indicating a dropdown action, followed by a list of menu items.

### Key Elements
- **Toggle Button**: Located at the top-left corner. It has a rectangular shape with rounded edges. The text "Relative" is displayed within the button. The button has a dark gray background with a white border and a white arrow pointing downwards.
- **Dropdown List**: Positioned directly below the toggle button. It contains two menu items:
  - **First Menu Item**: "Relative" is shown with a checkmark next to it, indicating it is currently selected. The text is white against a dark gray background.
  - **Second Menu Item**: "Absolute" is displayed without any additional indicators, suggesting it is not selected. The text is white against a dark gray background.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual element is the toggle button, as it draws immediate attention due to its placement and contrasting color scheme. The dropdown list follows logically beneath the button, with the selected item highlighted by a checkmark. There are no arrows or lines connecting the elements, but the layout implies a sequential reading order starting from the button and moving down through the list.

Snapping objects to values helps you align them precisely. By default, the Desktop Editor uses Relative snapping, but you can change it to use Absolute snapping.

| Snap Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Relative | Aligns objects based on their current position relative to other objects. This is useful to maintain consistent spacing or alignment between multiple objects in your scene. |
| Absolute | Aligns objects to a fixed grid or axis, regardless of their current position. This is useful to place objects at exact coordinates, or to align them to a specific grid. |

### Snap to Surfaces
