When you enter preview mode, you will start at your world’s spawn point. If an avatar is present, you can move it around a bit using the arrow keys to get a feel for how your users will experience your world. You can also change the direction the avatar faces using your mouse.

**Note**: The avatar displayed in the playtest will probably be your own personal avatar. In the actual game, the avatar of the user will be used.

[The auto-start and auto-stop options](../../../../images/output/img_20251211_043139_20251211_043139.md)

### Overview
This image displays a settings interface with two toggle switches related to simulation behavior during preview mode. The layout is simple, with options clearly labeled and visually distinct toggles.

### Key Elements
- **Toggle Switch 1**: Located on the right side under the label "Auto-start simulation on Preview entry". It has a blue background with a white circle indicating the current state.
- **Toggle Switch 2**: Positioned similarly to Toggle Switch 1 but under the label "Auto-stop simulation on Preview exit". It also has a blue background with a white circle.
- **Labels**: Both toggle switches have descriptive labels above them.
- **Background**: The background is dark gray, providing contrast to the lighter-colored toggles and labels.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The visual hierarchy is straightforward, with the toggles being the most prominent elements due to their placement and contrasting colors. There are no arrows or lines connecting the elements, suggesting that the user should read from top to bottom.

</details>

<p></p>



You can:

* Enable or disable simulation auto-start upon entry into preview mode.
* Enable or disable simulation auto-stop upon exit out of preview mode.

By configuring these options, it enables you to:

* Enter and exit preview mode with your world auto-simulating. This saves you from having to start simulation before entering preview mode, and having to stop simulation after leaving preview mode.
* Enter preview mode without simulation. This enables you to survey your world without requiring it to run for yourself, or for your in-world collaborators.
* Exit preview mode with simulation still running. This lets you:
  + Debug in the desktop editor.
  + Move entities.
  + Change world values.
  + Jump back into preview mode for immediate testing.

These auto-start and auto-stop settings persist across different worlds and sessions.

### Setting the preview device

By default, when you preview your world, you’ll see it in the desktop editor. However, you can choose a different device for the preview if you choose. For example, you can choose to preview for Mobile, which adjusts the viewport and other characteristics of the previewing. Options are available the **Preview Configuration** panel:
