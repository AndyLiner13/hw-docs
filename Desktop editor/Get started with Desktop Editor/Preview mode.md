When you enter preview mode, you will start at your world’s spawn point. If an avatar is present, you can move it around a bit using the arrow keys to get a feel for how your users will experience your world. You can also change the direction the avatar faces using your mouse.

**Note**: The avatar displayed in the playtest will probably be your own personal avatar. In the actual game, the avatar of the user will be used.

### Overview
This image displays a settings interface with two toggle switches related to simulation behavior during preview mode. The layout is simple, with options listed vertically against a dark background.

### Key Elements
- **Toggle Switch 1**: Located in the right column under the first option labeled "Auto-start simulation on Preview entry." It has a blue background with a white circle indicating the current state.
- **Toggle Switch 2**: Positioned similarly to Toggle Switch 1 but under the second option labeled "Auto-stop simulation on Preview exit." It also has a blue background with a white circle.
- **Option Labels**: Both options have labels in white text on a dark background.
- **Background**: A solid dark gray/black color fills the entire background.

</details>

<p></p>



You can:

* Enable or disable simulation auto-start upon entry into preview mode.
* Enable or disable simulation auto-stop upon exit out of preview mode.

By configuring these options, it enables you to:

* Enter and exit preview mode with your world auto-simulating. This saves you from having to start simulation before entering preview mode, and having to stop simulation after leaving preview mode.
* Enter preview mode without simulation. This enables you to survey your world without requiring it to run for yourself, or for your in-world collaborators.
* Exit preview mode with simulation still running. This lets you:
  + Debug in the desktop editor.
  + Move entities.
  + Change world values.
  + Jump back into preview mode for immediate testing.

These auto-start and auto-stop settings persist across different worlds and sessions.

### Setting the preview device

By default, when you preview your world, you’ll see it in the desktop editor. However, you can choose a different device for the preview if you choose. For example, you can choose to preview for Mobile, which adjusts the viewport and other characteristics of the previewing. Options are available the **Preview Configuration** panel:
