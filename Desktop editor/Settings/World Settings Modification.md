# World Settings Modification

The World Settings Modification feature in the Desktop Editor has the same capabilities to modify world settings as the VR editor. This includes the ability to change the world name, description, thumbnail, and many other settings. In addition, you can also publish or unpublish your world using this feature in the Desktop Editor.

## Opening the world settings panel

- Click the “Publish” button in the top right corner in the toolbar.
- A modal dialog with all of the available world settings will appear. ![Screenshot shows the desktop editor](https://scontent-dfw5-2.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/557410481_835743108963642_7769846685903609772_n.png?_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=e280be&_nc_ohc=-_uusA56U5gQ7kNvwG9DLm6&_nc_oc=AdnG39L0W2PLD6tBz3VVvdiLeCYF2Ss6SIGdv7Ep8MXA0OmiAR6YE-O8-oRZT3oDHXg&_nc_zt=14&_nc_ht=scontent-dfw5-2.xx&_nc_gid=2wed1FxZ5bnaD9C_J5G1JA&oh=00_AfiNRyXNGsjL1A_SzDaJwp3dhrdowcnzdMfSKLQDxmOBzQ&oe=692FB03D)
