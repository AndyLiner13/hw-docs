# Object Lock and Unlock

Locking objects can be helpful for:

* Stopping accidental movement.
* Viewport selection: locking can ensure that only the intended object is manipulated in complex scenes or in scenes where an object is surrounded or obstructed.

## Using Lock and Unlock

* The lock/unlock implementation in the Desktop Editor displays a lock icon in the hierarchy beside an object that is locked. This icon can be clicked to unlock the object.
* If you hover over an object that is unlocked, an unlock icon will appear that can be clicked to lock the object.
* When an object is “locked,” a user will not be able to move it using the manipulators or select it in the scene.
* In order to change properties from the property panel, the user must select the object from the hierarchy.
