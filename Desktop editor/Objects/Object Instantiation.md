  ### Overview
  This image depicts a screenshot of a Unity Editor interface, specifically showing the Hierarchy window on the left side and the Scene view on the right. The interface includes various panels and tools typical of a game development environment.
  
  ### Key Elements
  - **Hierarchy Panel**: Located on the left side, displaying a tree-like structure of game objects. It has a dark background with white text and icons. The text includes object names like "LOBBY," "[ARENA-CORE]," and "Broadside_EnvSFX."
  - **Search Bar**: Positioned at the top of the Hierarchy panel, labeled "Search hierarchy."
  - **Scene View**: On the right side, showing a 3D scene with a light brown floor and a blue skybox. There are some UI elements overlaid on the scene, such as a red arrow and a green cube.
  - **Asset Library Tab**: At the bottom of the screen, labeled "Asset Library," with options like "Console" and "Tests."
  - **Navigation Bar**: At the very top, containing tabs like "Build," "Systems," "Preview," "Scripts," and others related to game development.
  
  ### Visual Flow / Relationships
  The most prominent visual elements are the Hierarchy panel and the Scene view. The Scene view is the focal point, showing the 3D environment being worked on. The Hierarchy panel is secondary but essential for managing the objects within the scene. The navigation bar at the top provides access to different functionalities within the Unity Editor.

  ### Overview
  This image depicts a 3D modeling interface with a grid workspace, shape selection panel, and properties panel. The workspace shows a sphere placed at the center. The interface includes various controls for manipulating shapes and objects within the scene.
  
  ### Key Elements
  - **Shapes Panel**: Located on the left side, it displays a grid of 3D shape options such as cube, sphere, cone, cylinder, ramp, pyramid, tube, half-cylinder, half-tube, faceted-cylinder, capsule, torus, half-sphere, and cube-soft. The sphere option is highlighted with a red bounding box.
  - **Workspace**: The central area of the interface is a 3D grid workspace where a white sphere is positioned near the center.
  - **Properties Panel**: On the right side, it contains properties related to the selected object (Sphere). It includes toggles for visibility, collision, and attributes like position, rotation, scale, texture, material roughness, color, tag, physics settings, and script attachments.
  
  ### Visual Flow / Relationships
  The most prominent visual element is the sphere in the workspace. The shapes panel is secondary but serves as a reference for selecting new shapes. The properties panel is tertiary, providing detailed information about the currently selected object. There are no arrows or lines connecting elements, indicating a linear reading order from left to right and top to bottom.
