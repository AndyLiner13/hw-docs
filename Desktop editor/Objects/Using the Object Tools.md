### Overview
This image depicts a toolbar interface with various controls and options. The layout suggests a user interface likely from a software application, possibly related to video editing or similar tasks given the presence of angle measurement and percentage adjustment tools.

### Key Elements
- **Local, Center, Relative**: These are dropdown menus located at the top of the toolbar. They appear to allow users to select different modes for adjusting angles or percentages.
- **Angle Measurement**: A small icon resembling a protractor is situated next to the dropdown labeled "10°". This likely indicates the current angle setting.
- **Percentage Adjustment**: A slider or input field next to the "10%" label allows users to adjust a value, presumably related to the angle measurement.
- **Cursor Icon**: A standard arrow cursor icon is visible at the far left, indicating the mouse pointer's current position within the interface.
- **Additional Icons**: There are several icons at the very left side of the toolbar, which might represent different functions or settings within the application.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent elements are the dropdown menus and the angle measurement tool. The visual hierarchy is established by the placement of these elements, with the angle measurement being slightly more central compared to the dropdowns. The cursor icon is the smallest and least prominent but still noticeable due to its distinct shape.
