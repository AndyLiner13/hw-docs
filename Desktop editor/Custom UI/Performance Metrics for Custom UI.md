# Performance Metrics for Custom UI

There are 4 real-time metrics available to help with debugging Custom UI.

They are:

- Total # of visible UI
- Total # of value bindings
- Total data size of bindings (in KB)
- Binding update # in every frame

All the metrics can be seen under the [realtime metrics](../../Performance/Performance%20tools/Enabling%20and%20modifying%20the%20real-time%20metrics%20panel%20in%20VR.md) list.

### Overview
The image displays a user interface showing performance metrics and display settings in a virtual environment. The interface is divided into two main sections: Performance Metrics on the left and Display Settings on the right.

### Key Elements
- **Performance Metrics Section**:
  - **App Frame Time**: Displays "17.3 avg (0.5s)" with a graph line above indicating frame time over time.
  - **UI Binding Total Count**: Shows "1432.0 avg (0.5s)" with a progress bar below.
  - **UI Binding Total Size**: Indicates "33.0 avg (0.5s)" with another progress bar below.
  - **Inspect Button**: Located at the bottom right of the Performance Metrics section.
  - **Settings Icon**: A gear icon at the top right of the Performance Metrics section.
  - **Zoom In/Out Icons**: Two icons resembling a magnifying glass with plus and minus signs at the bottom left.

- **Display Settings Section**:
  - **Checkbox List**: Contains several checkboxes labeled with items such as "Verts Updates L.", "Verts Updates R.", "Verts SS RTT", etc.
  - **Progress Bars**: Each checkbox has a corresponding progress bar next to it.
  - **Highlighted Items**: Three checkboxes are highlighted with red circles, specifically "UI Binding Update", "UI Binding Total Count", and "UI Binding Total Size".

### Visual Flow / Relationships
- **Most Prominent Element**: The Performance Metrics section is more prominent due to its larger size and central placement.
- **Arrows/Connectors**: There are no arrows or connectors visible in the image.
- **Spatial Relationships**: The Performance Metrics section is on the left, while the Display Settings section is on the right. The highlighted checkboxes in the Display Settings section draw attention to specific metrics within that section.

### Overview
This image depicts a performance metrics interface, likely from a software application or game development tool. It displays various performance indicators such as frame time, UI binding total count, and UI binding total size. The layout includes graphs, numerical data, and interactive controls.

### Key Elements
- **Graphs**: Two main graphs are shown. The top graph uses green and blue lines to represent frame times over frames. The bottom graph uses orange and teal lines to show UI binding total count and size.
- **Numerical Data**: Below the graphs, there are numerical values indicating averages, targets, maximums, and minimums for both UI binding total count and size.
- **Interactive Controls**: Buttons at the top right corner allow navigation through the performance metrics.
- **Background**: A blurred background suggests a store-like environment, possibly a virtual or physical setting.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The most prominent visual elements are the graphs and numerical data. The graphs are horizontally oriented, with the x-axis representing frames and the y-axis showing performance metrics. The numerical data is placed below the graphs, providing specific values for reference. The interactive controls are located at the top right, facilitating user interaction with the metrics.
