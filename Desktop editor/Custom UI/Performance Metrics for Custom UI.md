# Performance Metrics for Custom UI

There are 4 real-time metrics available to help with debugging Custom UI.

They are:

- Total # of visible UI
- Total # of value bindings
- Total data size of bindings (in KB)
- Binding update # in every frame

All the metrics can be seen under the [realtime metrics](../../Performance/Performance%20tools/Enabling%20and%20modifying%20the%20real-time%20metrics%20panel%20in%20VR.md) list.

### Overview
The image displays a user interface showing performance metrics and display settings. The left side of the interface presents performance data, while the right side shows adjustable display settings.

### Key Elements
- **Performance Metrics Section**:
  - **App Frame Time**: Displays "17.3 avg (0.5s)" with a red dot indicating the average frame time.
  - **UI Binding Total Count**: Shows "1432.0 avg (0.5s)" with a blue line indicating the average count.
  - **UI Binding Total Size**: Displays "33.0 avg (0.5s)" with a purple line indicating the average size.
  - **Inspect Button**: Located at the bottom right of the performance metrics section.
  
- **Display Settings Section**:
  - **Settings Toggle**: Located at the top right of the display settings section.
  - **Checkbox List**: Contains checkboxes labeled "Verts Updates L.", "Verts Updates R.", "Verts SS RTT", "Verts RPC Sent", "Verts RPC Received", "UI Binding Update", "UI Binding Total Count", and "UI Binding Total Size". The last three checkboxes are checked and circled in red.
  - **Input Fields**: Next to each checkbox, there are input fields with numerical values such as "10", "40", "10", "10", "5", "1500", "60", and "10".

### Visual Flow / Relationships
- **Most Prominent Element**: The performance metrics section is the most prominent due to its larger size and central placement.
- **Arrows/Connectors**: There are no arrows or connectors visible in the image.
- **Spatial Relationships**: The performance metrics section is on the left, and the display settings section is on the right. The checkboxes within the display settings section are grouped together and are the focal point of interaction.

### Overview
This image displays a performance metrics interface, likely from a software application or game development tool. It includes a timeline graph and various data points related to frame time and UI binding metrics.

### Key Elements
- **Timeline Graph**: A horizontal timeline with a green waveform representing frame times. The timeline has numerical markers at intervals along the bottom.
  - **Visual description**: Green waveform, horizontal line with numerical markers.
  - **Location**: Top section of the interface.
  - **Contents**: Frame times marked with numerical values such as "frames 4721," "5207," etc.
  - **Visual styling**: Dark background with light grid lines, green waveform, white markers.

- **Frame Time Data**: A blue highlighted area on the timeline graph indicating a specific range of frame times.
  - **Visual description**: Blue rectangle highlighting a portion of the timeline.
  - **Location**: Top section of the interface, above the green waveform.
  - **Contents**: Numerical values indicating target, max, and min frame times.
  - **Visual styling**: Blue rectangle, white numerical values.

- **UI Binding Metrics**: Two sections labeled "UI Binding Total Count" and "UI Binding Total Size."
  - **Visual description**: Orange and teal horizontal bars with numerical values.
  - **Location**: Bottom section of the interface.
  - **Contents**: Numerical values indicating average, target, max, and min for both metrics.
  - **Visual styling**: Orange and teal bars, white numerical values.

- **Navigation Controls**: Small icons located near the middle of the interface.
  - **Visual description**: Circular icons with symbols.
  - **Location**: Center of the interface, slightly below the timeline graph.
  - **Contents**: Symbols for backward, forward, and other navigation actions.
  - **Visual styling**: White circular icons with colored symbols.

- **Back Button**: Located at the bottom right corner.
  - **Visual description**: Rectangular button with the word "Back."
  - **Location**: Bottom right corner of the interface.
  - **Contents**: Text "Back."
  - **Visual styling**: Gray button with black text.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
- **Most Prominent Element**: The timeline graph with the green waveform.
- **Arrows/Connections**: Horizontal timeline with numerical markers and a blue highlighted area.
- **Spatial Relationships**: Timeline graph at the top, navigation controls in the center, and UI binding metrics at the bottom.
