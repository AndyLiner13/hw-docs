# Video presentation of creating performant custom UIs in Meta Horizon Worlds

The custom UI feature enables you to build customizable and interactive UI panels in your worlds. The UI gizmo controls where and how the UI panel is placed. The TypeScript API controls the content, style, and interaction effects of the panel. The video presentation offers an in-depth technical talk about how the custom UI feature works and best practices for creating performant UI for your experiences.
