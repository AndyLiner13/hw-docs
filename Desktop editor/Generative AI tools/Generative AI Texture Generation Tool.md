## UV Requirements for Texture Generation

In order to succeed, the UVs on your mesh must have:

* A single square texture.
* No overlapping UV islands.

If the UVs on your model pass these requirements, the pipeline will generate a texture using your UVs.

If any of these requirements fail or you don’t have any UVs, the pipeline will Auto-UV your mesh in order to generate a texture for it. In this case, when you apply the generated texture back to your model, things will look unfinished: stretched, squashed, faded, or in some way not successfully generated.

To fix this, you should Auto-UV your model yourself–using Blender or Houdini or another DCC–before sending the model for preprocessing. This is typically a couple of nodes in each DCC. You may have to experiment to get the best results, but a general Auto-UV should ensure that the generated textures remain legible when applied to your mesh.
