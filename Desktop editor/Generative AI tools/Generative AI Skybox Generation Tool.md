## Generate Skyboxes for your world

To generate a skybox for your world, use the following process:

- Select the GenAI icon from the toolbar, then select Skybox.
- Enter a prompt into the prompt field and select a style to base the generated skybox on. The Horizon GenAI tool will then generate several skybox options based on your input prompt and selected style.
- Once the options are generated, select one of the generated options to create a preview of the skybox. You can use the **Style** drop-down menu to select one of the six available styles for your generated skybox.
- Once your skybox options are generated, select the option that most fits your created world.

## Save your generated skybox

Once a skybox has been generated for your world, you can save it to your asset library.

To save to your asset library, hover over your generated asset and select the **Export to asset library** option.

**Note**: You can also download and save your generated skybox to your local disk using the download icon.
