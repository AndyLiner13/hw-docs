# Generative AI Style Reference

The Horizon Gen AI Style Reference feature allows the creation of a style that informs other content you create using Horizon Gen AI tools. With Style Reference, you can establish a style that helps build a cohesive world look and feel in your created world. Consistency for your generated content can help accelerate the world creation process, and ensure your users have a cohesive experience in your world.

Once a style reference is created you can:

* Apply to additional generated content for your world.
* Save it and reuse the generated style for future content.
* Swap between generated styles to dynamically alter the context window for generated content when world building.

**Note**: When using a style reference for your generated content, you will be rate limited according to your selected generation output. Check the **Gen AI Tool Availability & Rates** for rate limit information.
