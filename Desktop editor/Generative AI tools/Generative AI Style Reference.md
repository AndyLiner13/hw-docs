# Generative AI Style Reference

The Horizon Gen AI Style Reference feature allows the creation of a style that informs other content you create using Horizon Gen AI tools. With Style Reference, you can establish a style that helps build a cohesive world look and feel in your created world. Consistency for your generated content can help accelerate the world creation process, and ensure your users have a cohesive experience in your world.

Once a style reference is created you can:

* Apply to additional generated content for your world.
* Save it and reuse the generated style for future content.
* Swap between generated styles to dynamically alter the context window for generated content when world building.

**Note**: When using a style reference for your generated content, you will be rate limited according to your selected generation output. Check the **Gen AI Tool Availability & Rates** for rate limit information.

- With a style reference applied, select either the **3D Model** option or **Texture** option. Note that other **Gen AI** features will be inaccessible with a style reference enabled.
- If using the **3D Model** option, select the **3D Model Detail** and **Generation Model** for the generation, then input a prompt in the prompt window. If using the **Texture** feature, select a mesh in your world then input a prompt in the prompt window.
