The Generative AI Creation Tool assists in the audio creation process, taking it from a potentially daunting process to a simple matter of clicking a few buttons and adding the resulting audio!

The Generative AI Creation Tool provides two audio generation modes: sound effect generation and ambient audio generation. Sound effect generation is useful when attempting to create short audio clips, while ambient audio generation is useful when generating longer background tracks.

You can either select sounds based on example prompts, or create your own custom prompts and see what sounds you can come up with.

Once you have that perfect sound, you can use it to create audio assets for your world, or download it to your local hard drive for future use.

Additionally, the tool is located in the Horizon Desktop Editor, making it not only easy to use, but easy to navigate to whenever you need it.
