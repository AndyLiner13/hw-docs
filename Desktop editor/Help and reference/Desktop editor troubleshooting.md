### Key Elements
- **Visual description**: The dropdown menu has a dark background with white text and light gray separators between items.
- **Location**: The menu is located on the left side of the screen, extending downward from the top-left corner.
- **Contents**: 
    - **Return to Creation Home**: This item is at the top of the menu.
    - **View Application Logs**: Followed by other menu items such as "Launch Typescript Editor," "Publish World," "Rename World," etc.
    - **[dev-only] Internal Options**: This item has a right-pointing arrow indicating more options underneath.
- **Visual styling**: The text is in a sans-serif font, and the menu items are evenly spaced. The separators are thin and light gray, providing a subtle distinction between items.

### Visual Flow / Relationships
The menu items are arranged in a vertical list, with no arrows or lines connecting them. The most prominent feature is the right-pointing arrow next to "[dev-only] Internal Options," which suggests that clicking this option would reveal further choices.
